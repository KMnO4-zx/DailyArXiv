| **[Time-Varying Confounding Bias in Observational Geoscience with Application to Induced Seismicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16360v1)** | 2025-10-18 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.16360v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evidence derived primarily from physical models has identified saltwater disposal as the dominant causal factor that contributes to induced seismicity. To complement physical models, statistical/machine learning (ML) models are designed to measure associations from observational data, either with parametric regression models or more flexible ML models. However, it is often difficult to interpret the statistical significance of a parameter or the predicative power of a model as evidence of causation. We adapt a causal inference framework with the potential outcomes perspective to explicitly define what we meant by causal effect and declare necessary identification conditions to recover unbiased causal effect estimates. In particular, we illustrate the threat of time-varying confounding in observational longitudinal geoscience data through simulations and adapt established statistical methods for longitudinal analysis from the causal interference literature to estimate the effect of wastewater disposal on earthquakes in the Fort-Worth Basin of North Central Texas from 2013 to 2016.</p></details> |  |

Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

We are encouraged to observe that earth scientists from developing countries have gained better visibility in the recent AI for Science (AI4S) paradigm and that AI is also improving the landscape of international collaboration in geoscience-related research.</p></details> | <details><summary>misco...</summary><p>miscommunication in the authorization process from the first author</p></details> |
| **[RAG for Geoscience: What We Expect, Gaps and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11246v1)** | 2025-08-15 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.11246v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by combining retrieval with generation. However, its current workflow remains largely text-centric, limiting its applicability in geoscience. Many geoscientific tasks are inherently evidence-hungry. Typical examples involve imputing missing observations using analog scenes, retrieving equations and parameters to calibrate models, geolocating field photos based on visual cues, or surfacing historical case studies to support policy analyses. A simple ``retrieve-then-generate'' pipeline is insufficient for these needs. We envision Geo-RAG, a next-generation paradigm that reimagines RAG as a modular retrieve $\rightarrow$ reason $\rightarrow$ generate $\rightarrow$ verify loop. Geo-RAG supports four core capabilities: (i) retrieval of multi-modal Earth data; (ii) reasoning under physical and domain constraints; (iii) generation of science-grade artifacts; and (iv) verification of generated hypotheses against numerical models, ground measurements, and expert assessments. This shift opens new opportunities for more trustworthy and transparent geoscience workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoRSMLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Vision-Language Tasks in Geoscience and Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12490v1)** | 2025-03-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12490v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  |

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accpe...</summary><p>accpeted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> |

In this work, we discuss a series of developments in the field of prototype-based XAI that show potential for scientific learning tasks, with a focus on the geosciences. We organize the prototype-based XAI literature into three themes: the development and visualization of prototypes, types of prototypes, and the use of prototypes in various learning tasks. We discuss how the authors use prototype-based methods, their novel contributions, and any limitations or challenges that may arise when adapting these methods for geoscientific learning tasks. We highlight differences between geoscientific data sets and the standard benchmarks used to develop XAI methods, and discuss how specific geoscientific applications may benefit from using or modifying existing prototype-based XAI techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI for Science Workshop-Oral (Attention Track), Proceedings of 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Geoscience Artificial Intelligence (XGeoS-AI): Application to Demystify Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04940v2)** | 2024-05-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.04940v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth science enters the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) not only offers great potential for solving geoscience problems, but also plays a critical role in accelerating the understanding of the complex, interactive, and multiscale processes of Earth's behavior. As geoscience AI models are progressively utilized for significant predictions in crucial situations, geoscience researchers are increasingly demanding their interpretability and versatility. This study proposes an interpretable geoscience artificial intelligence (XGeoS-AI) framework to unravel the mystery of image recognition in the Earth sciences, and its effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated by taking computed tomography (CT) image recognition as an example. Inspired by the mechanism of human vision, the proposed XGeoS-AI framework generates a threshold value from a local region within the whole image to complete the recognition. Different kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can be adopted as the AI engines of the proposed XGeoS-AI framework to efficiently complete geoscience image recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness, versatility, and heuristics of the proposed framework have great potential in solving geoscience image recognition problems. Interpretable AI should receive more and more attention in the field of the Earth sciences, which is the key to promoting more rational and wider applications of AI in the field of Earth sciences. In addition, the proposed interpretable framework may be the forerunner of technological innovation in the Earth sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some erros in the results, and a newer revision is still preparing</p></details> |
| **[GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00434v2)** | 2024-04-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2401.00434v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success for their general knowledge and ability to solve a wide spectrum of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically, GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens, preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica, including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training, SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.</p></details> |  |

The underlying idea of our approach for selecting knots is to apply the generalized lasso, since the knots of the B-spline basis can be seen as changes in the derivatives of the function to be estimated. This method was then extended to functions depending on several variables by processing each dimension independently, thus reducing the problem to a univariate setting. The regularization parameters were chosen by means of a criterion based on EBIC. The nonparametric estimator was obtained using a multivariate B-spline regression with the corresponding selected knots. Our procedure was validated through numerical experiments by varying the number of observations and the level of noise to investigate its robustness. The influence of observation sampling was also assessed and our method was applied to a chemical system commonly used in geoscience. For each different framework considered in this paper, our approach performed better than state-of-the-art methods. Our completely data-driven method is implemented in the glober R package which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</p></details> | 29 pages, 27 figures |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Generative AI and Large Language Models: Foundations, Trends, and Future Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03349v1)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.03349v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) represents an emerging field that promises the creation of synthetic data and outputs in different modalities. GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models that have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks (GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience community in several applications, including (but not limited to) data generation/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze removal, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain such as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and trustworthiness. Beyond that, GAI models show promises to the geoscience community, especially with the support to climate change, urban science, atmospheric science, marine science, and planetary science through their extraordinary ability to data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable modeling to unify machine learning and physical models and advance Geosciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04027v2)** | 2023-12-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2301.04027v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-Based Modeling (PBM) and Machine Learning (ML) are often perceived as distinct paradigms in the geosciences. Here we present differentiable geoscientific modeling as a powerful pathway toward dissolving the perceived barrier between them and ushering in a paradigm shift. For decades, PBM offered benefits in interpretability and physical consistency but struggled to efficiently leverage large datasets. ML methods, especially deep networks, presented strong predictive skills yet lacked the ability to answer specific scientific questions. While various methods have been proposed for ML-physics integration, an important underlying theme -- differentiable modeling -- is not sufficiently recognized. Here we outline the concepts, applicability, and significance of differentiable geoscientific modeling (DG). "Differentiable" refers to accurately and efficiently calculating gradients with respect to model variables, critically enabling the learning of high-dimensional unknown relationships. DG refers to a range of methods connecting varying amounts of prior knowledge to neural networks and training them together, capturing a different scope than physics-guided machine learning and emphasizing first principles. Preliminary evidence suggests DG offers better interpretability and causality than ML, improved generalizability and extrapolation capability, and strong potential for knowledge discovery, while approaching the performance of purely data-driven ML. DG models require less training data while scaling favorably in performance and efficiency with increasing amounts of data. With DG, geoscientists may be better able to frame and investigate questions, test hypotheses, and discover unrecognized linkages.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model. Moreover, we share a protocol that can efficiently gather domain-specific data and construct domain-supervised data, even in situations where manpower is scarce. Meanwhile, we equip K2 with the abilities of using tools to be a naive geoscience aide. Experiments conducted on the GeoBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and datasets on geoscience knowledge understanding and utilization.We open-source all the training data and K2 model checkpoints at https://github.com/davendw49/k2.</p></details> |  |

AI algorithms, especially deep learning-based ones, have been developed and applied widely to RS data analysis. The successful application of AI covers almost all aspects of Earth observation (EO) missions, from low-level vision tasks like super-resolution, denoising and inpainting, to high-level vision tasks like scene classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. While AI techniques enable researchers to observe and understand the Earth more accurately, the vulnerability and uncertainty of AI models deserve further attention, considering that many geoscience and RS tasks are highly safety-critical. This paper reviews the current development of AI security in the geoscience and RS field, covering the following five important aspects: adversarial attack, backdoor attack, federated learning, uncertainty and explainability. Moreover, the potential opportunities and trends are discussed to provide insights for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to provide a systematic review of AI security-related research in the geoscience and RS community. Available code and datasets are also listed in the paper to move this vibrant field of research forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coarse-to-fine Task-driven Inpainting for Geoscience Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11059v3)** | 2022-12-06 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2211.11059v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The processing and recognition of geoscience images have wide applications. Most of existing researches focus on understanding the high-quality geoscience images by assuming that all the images are clear. However, in many real-world cases, the geoscience images might contain occlusions during the image acquisition. This problem actually implies the image inpainting problem in computer vision and multimedia. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing image inpainting algorithms learn to repair the occluded regions for a better visualization quality, they are excellent for natural images but not good enough for geoscience images by ignoring the geoscience related tasks. This paper aims to repair the occluded regions for a better geoscience task performance with the advanced visualization quality simultaneously, without changing the current deployed deep learning based geoscience models. Because of the complex context of geoscience images, we propose a coarse-to-fine encoder-decoder network with coarse-to-fine adversarial context discriminators to reconstruct the occluded image regions. Due to the limited data of geoscience images, we use a MaskMix based data augmentation method to exploit more information from limited geoscience image data. The experimental results on three public geoscience datasets for remote sensing scene recognition, cross-view geolocation and semantic segmentation tasks respectively show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.</p></details> |  |

However, the predominant reliance on visual encoding of data continues to create accessibility barriers for people who are blind/vision impaired resulting in their under representation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This research study seeks to understand the experiences of professionals who are blind/vision impaired in one such STEM discipline (geosciences) in accessing data visualizations. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven professionals were conducted to examine the accessibility barriers and areas for improvement to inform accessibility research pertaining to data visualizations through a socio-technical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of visualizations in influencing their career path, lack of data exploration tools for research, barriers in accessing works of peers and mismatched pace of visualization and accessibility research. The article also includes recommendations from the participants to address some of these accessibility barriers.</p></details> |  |

Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated preprint version of the manuscript.

Quantifying complexity and non-stationarity of these data is a challenging task, and advanced complexity-based exploratory tool are required for understanding and visualizing such data. This paper discusses the Fisher-Shannon method, from which one can obtain a complexity measure and detect non-stationarity, as an efficient data exploration tool. The state-of-the-art studies related to the Fisher-Shannon measures are collected, and new analytical formulas for positive unimodal skewed distributions are proposed. Case studies on both synthetic and real data illustrate the usefulness of the Fisher-Shannon method, which can find application in different domains including time series discrimination and generation of times series features for clustering, modeling and forecasting. The paper is accompanied with Python and R libraries for the non-parametric estimation of the proposed measures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference, thus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions, and 2) the estimation of {\em statistical independence} between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the {\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.</p></details> |  |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex and elusive interactions between processes. In this paper we explore a framework to derive cause-effect relations from pairs of variables via regression and dependence estimation. We propose to focus on the sensitivity (curvature) of the dependence estimator to account for the asymmetry of the forward and inverse densities of approximation residuals. Results in a large collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems demonstrate the good capabilities of the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1611.00555, arXiv:2012.05150</p></details> |

A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope. In general, I aim to provide context for the recent enthusiasm surrounding deep learning with respect to research, hardware, and software developments that enable successful application of shallow and deep machine learning in all disciplines of Earth science.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 17 figures, book chapter</p></details> |

As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The second version of this manuscript is currently under review at the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)</p></details> |

Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media, memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming "enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression techniques.</p></details> |  |

They have been applied in numerous science areas, but their application to the geosciences has been limited due to their inefficiency in high-dimensional systems in standard settings. However, huge progress has been made, and this limitation is disappearing fast due to recent developments in proposal densities, the use of ideas from (optimal) transportation, the use of localisation and intelligent adaptive resampling strategies. Furthermore, powerful hybrids between particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods have been developed. We present a state of the art discussion of present efforts of developing particle filters for highly nonlinear geoscience state-estimation problems with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic applications, including many new ideas, derivations, and unifications, highlighting hidden connections, and generating a valuable tool and guide for the community. Initial experiments show that particle filters can be competitive with present-day methods for numerical weather prediction suggesting that they will become mainstream soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Review paper, 36 pages, 9 figures, Resubmitted to Q.J.Royal Meteorol.

A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is easy to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the corresponding exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated log-normal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a truncated power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated log-normals, although wildfires also may show power-law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to the analyzed data sets, but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in the future.</p></details> |  |

This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. Data assimilation is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of data assimilation, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of data assimilation being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of data assimilation and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 10 figures, Invited review</p></details> |

Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks can be found at https://github.com/zhengxuJosh/Awesome-Spatial-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Speculative decoding, which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[PureKV: Plug-and-Play KV Cache Optimization with Spatial-Temporal Sparse Attention for Vision-Language Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25600v1)** | 2025-10-29 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.25600v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Large Models (VLLMs) face significant efficiency challenges when processing high-resolution inputs. The quadratic complexity in attention and autoregressive generation, as well as the constantly growing key value (KV) cache size, severely hinder the prefilling and decoding stages. Recent efforts have attempted to compress KV cache by identifying and pruning KV cache of less important tokens, but these methods typically rely on attention scores to estimate token importance, making them incompatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Sparse Attention, which do not explicitly compute attention matrices. Moreover, existing methods overlook how sparse attention, while accelerating the prefilling stage, alters the information structure of the KV cache, thereby compromising the effectiveness of downstream KV cache compression strategies. To address this issue, we propose PureKV, a plug-and-play framework for joint optimization of sparse attention and KV cache compression. We first introduce a KV cache compression strategy that is fully compatible with efficient attention accelerators. Our method utilizes lower layer attention scores to estimate the importance of high layers' KV cache, enabling active pruning without compromising accuracy. In addition, we have designed a Spatial-Temporal Sparse Attention (ST-SpAttn) module specifically tailored for video KV cache compression algorithms. This module combines spatial and temporal attention sparsity to improve the compression efficiency of KV cache optimization algorithms by purifying spatial noise and temporal redundancy in KV cache. At the same time, ST-SpAttn also accelerated the prefilling stage of VLLMs. Extensive experiments on VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2, Qwen2.5-VL) have shown that PureKV achieves 5.0 times KV cache compression and 3.16 times prefill acceleration, with negligible quality degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust variable selection for spatial point processes observed with noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25550v1)** | 2025-10-29 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.25550v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for variable selection in the intensity function of spatial point processes that combines sparsity-promoting estimation with noise-robust model selection. As high-resolution spatial data becomes increasingly available through remote sensing and automated image analysis, identifying spatial covariates that influence the localization of events is crucial to understand the underlying mechanism. However, results from automated acquisition techniques are often noisy, for example due to measurement uncertainties or detection errors, which leads to spurious displacements and missed events. We study the impact of such noise on sparse point-process estimation across different models, including Poisson and Thomas processes. To improve noise robustness, we propose to use stability selection based on point-process subsampling and to incorporate a non-convex best-subset penalty to enhance model-selection performance. In extensive simulations, we demonstrate that such an approach reliably recovers true covariates under diverse noise scenarios and improves both selection accuracy and stability. We then apply the proposed method to a forestry data set, analyzing the distribution of trees in relation to elevation and soil nutrients in a tropical rain forest. This shows the practical utility of the method, which provides a systematic framework for robust variable selection in spatial point-process models under noise, without requiring additional knowledge of the process.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Open3D-VQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to reason about complex spatial relationships from an aerial perspective. The benchmark comprises 73k QA pairs spanning 7 general spatial reasoning tasks, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer formats, and supports both visual and point cloud modalities. The questions are automatically generated from spatial relations extracted from both real-world and simulated aerial scenes. Evaluation on 13 popular MLLMs reveals that: 1) Models are generally better at answering questions about relative spatial relations than absolute distances, 2) 3D LLMs fail to demonstrate significant advantages over 2D LLMs, and 3) Fine-tuning solely on the simulated dataset can significantly improve the model's spatial reasoning performance in real-world scenarios. We release our benchmark, data generation pipeline, and evaluation toolkit to support further research: https://github.com/EmbodiedCity/Open3D-VQA.code.</p></details> |  |

When the spatial locations of some observations are missing, joint inference of the fields and locations is possible as the fields inform the locations and vice versa. If the number of missing locations is large, conventional Bayesian Inference fails if the generative model for the data is even slightly mis-specified, due to feedback between estimated fields and the imputed locations. Semi-Modular Inference (SMI) offers a solution by controlling the feedback between different modular components of the joint model using a hyper-parameter called the influence parameter. Our work is motivated by linguistic studies on a large corpus of late-medieval English textual dialects. We simultaneously learn dialect fields using dialect features observed in ``anchor texts'' with known location and estimate the location of origin for ``floating'' textual dialects of unknown origin. The optimal influence parameter minimises a loss measuring the accuracy of held-out anchor data. We compute a (flow-based) variational approximation to the SMI posterior for our model. This allows efficient computation of the optimal influence. MCMC-based approaches, feasible on small subsets of the data, are used to check the variational approximation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was withdrawn as a consequence to its merge to the updated version at arXiv link arXiv:2412.16419</p></details> |

The cooperative base stations (BSs) are equipped with TRIS transceivers to accomplish sensing data acquisition, communication offloading, and computation in a time slot. In order to obtain higher cooperation gain, we utilize a signal-level spatial registration algorithm, which is realized by adjusting the beamwidth. Meanwhile, for more efficient offloading of the computational task, multistream communication is considered, and rank-$N$ constraints are introduced, which are handled using an iterative rank minimization (IRM) scheme. We construct an optimization problem with the objective function of minimizing the total energy consumption of the network to jointly optimize the beamforming matrix, time slot allocation, sensing data allocation and sensing beam scheduling variables. Due to the coupling of the variables, the proposed problem is a non-convex optimization problem, which we decouple and solve using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme. Finally, numerical simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving the overall network performance and reducing the total energy consumption of the network.</p></details> |  |

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

Existing approaches often overlook these spatial relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable manipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation Ordering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and efficiency, enabling robust manipulation in cluttered scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

CNFs are benchmarked against Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and a convolutional autoencoder within a unified encoding-decoding framework and a common evaluation protocol that explicitly separates in-range (interpolative) from out-of-range (strict extrapolative) testing beyond the training horizon, with identical preprocessing, metrics, and fixed splits across all baselines. We examine three conditioning mechanisms: (i) activation-only modulation (often termed FiLM), (ii) low-rank weight and bias modulation (termed FP), and (iii) last-layer inner-product coupling, and introduce a novel domain-decomposed CNF that localizes complexities. Across representative turbulence datasets (WMLES channel inflow, DNS channel inflow, and wall pressure fluctuations over turbulent boundary layers), CNF-FP achieves the lowest training and in-range testing errors, while CNF-FiLM generalizes best for out-of-range scenarios once moderate latent capacity is available. Domain decomposition significantly improves out-of-range accuracy, especially for the more demanding datasets. The study provides a rigorous, physics-aware basis for selecting conditioning, capacity, and domain decomposition when using CNFs for turbulence compression and reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Advances in robust Bayesian methods and the incorporation of spatial correlation into CRT design and analysis remain relatively underdeveloped. This paper introduces a Bayesian spatial point process framework that models individuals nested within geographic clusters while explicitly accounting for spatial dependence. We demonstrate that conventional non-spatial models consistently underestimate uncertainty and lead to misleading inferences, whereas our spatial approach improves estimation stability, controls type I error, and enhances statistical power.

We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF) and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT, G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance, localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH, screwing, and surface wiping tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and principles.

In this work, we investigate a new anomaly-in-mean problem in multidimensional spatial lattice, that is, to detect the number and locations of anomaly ''spatial regions'' from the baseline. In addition to the classic minimisation over the cost function with a $L_0$ penalisation, we introduce an innovative penalty on the area of the minimum convex hull that covers the anomaly regions. We show that the proposed method yields a consistent estimation of the number of anomalies, and it achieves near optimal localisation error under the minimax framework. We also propose a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the double penalised cost minimisation approximately, and carry out large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to examine its numeric performance. The method has a wide range of applications in real-world problems. As an example, we apply it to detect the marine heatwaves using the sea surface temperature data from the European Space Agency.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches predominantly rely on visual data or end-to-end learning, which limits fine-grained contextual modeling. This work aims to enhance surgical scene representations by integrating 3D acoustic information, enabling temporally and spatially aware multimodal understanding of surgical environments. Methods: We propose a novel framework for generating 4D audio-visual representations of surgical scenes by projecting acoustic localization information from a phased microphone array onto dynamic point clouds from an RGB-D camera. A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies relevant temporal segments containing tool-tissue interactions which are spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation. The system was experimentally evaluated in a realistic operating room setup during simulated surgical procedures performed by experts. Results: The proposed method successfully localizes surgical acoustic events in 3D space and associates them with visual scene elements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates accurate spatial sound localization and robust fusion of multimodal data, providing a comprehensive, dynamic representation of surgical activity.

This paper introduces an integrated methodological framework for spreading samples over the population's spatial coordinates. First, we propose a new, translation-invariant spreadness index that quantifies spatial balance with a clear interpretation. Second, we develop a clustering method that balances clusters with respect to an auxiliary variable; when the auxiliary variable is the inclusion probability, the procedure yields clusters whose totals are one, so that a single draw per cluster is, in principle, representative and produces units optimally spread along the population coordinates, an attractive feature for finite population sampling. Third, building on the graphical sampling framework, we design an efficient sampling scheme that further enhances spatial balance. At its core lies an intelligent, computationally efficient search layer that adapts to the population's spatial structure and inclusion probabilities, tailoring a design to each specific population to maximize spread. Across diverse spatial patterns and both equal- and unequal-probability regimes, this intelligent coupling consistently outperformed all rival spread-oriented designs on dispersion metrics, while the spreadness index remained informative and the clustering step improved representativeness.</p></details> |  |

We propose a systematic framework built on four core components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing, Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature, top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks.

However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Empirically, we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6% human validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from 2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16% human-validated accuracy$\unicode{x2014}$compared to 57.6% on a dataset generated by recent work. Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data, models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6 question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5% on BDD and 37.9% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as BLINK.

Existing topological segmentation loss functions are primarily based on the persistent homology of the image. They match the persistent features from the segmentation with the persistent features from the ground truth and minimize the difference between them. However, these methods suffer from an ambiguous matching problem since the matching only relies on the information in the topological space. In this work, we propose an effective and efficient Spatial-Aware Topological Loss Function that further leverages the information in the original spatial domain of the image to assist the matching of persistent features. Extensive experiments on images of various types of tubular structures show that the proposed method has superior performance in improving the topological accuracy of the segmentation compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation, in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling open-world perception.

Thus, a common practice is to solve CEP over zonal models with low spatial resolution rather than over full-scale nodal power networks. Due to improvements in solving large-scale stochastic mixed integer programs, these computational limitations are becoming less relevant, and the assumption that zonal models are realistic and useful approximations of nodal CEP is worth revisiting. This work is the first to conduct a systematic computational study on the assumption that spatial aggregation can reasonably be used for ISO- and interconnect-scale CEP. By considering a realistic, large-scale test network based on the state of California with over 8,000 buses and 10,000 transmission lines, we demonstrate that well-designed small spatial aggregations can yield good approximations but that coarser zonal models result in large distortions of investment decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, submitted to 2026 Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC)</p></details> |

Similar to professional image-editing software, the proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy.

Although approaches have been proposed to support spatial dataset search and data point search, they consider the two types of searches independently. To enable search operations ranging from the coarse-grained dataset level to the fine-grained data point level, we provide an integrated one that supports diverse query types and distance metrics. In this paper, we focus on designing a multi-granularity spatial data search system, called Spadas, that supports both dataset and data point search operations. To address the challenges of the high cost of indexing and susceptibility to outliers, we propose a unified index that can drastically improve query efficiency in various scenarios by organizing data reasonably and removing outliers in datasets. Moreover, to accelerate all data search operations, we propose a set of pruning mechanisms based on the unified index, including fast bound estimation, approximation technique with error bound, and pruning in batch techniques, to effectively filter out non-relevant datasets and points. Finally, we report the results of a detailed experimental evaluation using six spatial data repositories, achieving orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrating the effectiveness by case study. An online spatial data search system of Spadas is also implemented and made accessible to users.</p></details> |  |

However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations.

These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution (SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in super-resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We develop a general framework for causal effect estimation that relaxes the commonly assumed requirement that exposures contain higher-frequency variation than confounders. We propose basis voting, a plurality-rule estimator - novel in the spatial literature - that consistently identifies causal effects only under the assumption that, in a spatial basis expansion of the exposure and confounder, there exist several basis functions in the support of the exposure but not the confounder. This assumption generalizes existing assumptions of differential basis support used for identification of the causal effect under spatial confounding, and does not require prior knowledge of which basis functions satisfy this support condition. We also show that the standard projection-based estimator used in other methods relying on differential support is inefficient, and provide a more efficient novel estimator. Extensive simulations and a real-world application demonstrate that our approach reliably recovers unbiased causal estimates whenever exposure and confounder signals are separable on a plurality of basis functions. Importantly, by not relying on higher-frequency variation, our method remains applicable to settings where exposures are smooth spatial functions, such as distance to pollution sources or major roadways, common in environmental studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 8 figures, supplementary appendix included</p></details> |

Building on our previous studies, which establish Navier-Stokes-based approaches to spatial treatment effects and financial network fragility, we demonstrate that technology adoption spreads simultaneously through both geographic proximity and supply chain connections. Using comprehensive data on six technologies adopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First, technology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial decay rate $\kappa \approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of $d^* \approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared = 0.99). Second, supply chain connections create technology-specific networks whose algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) increases 300-380 percent as adoption spreads, with correlation between $\lambda_2$ and adoption exceeding 0.95 across all technologies. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods that ignore spatial and network structure exhibit 61 percent bias in estimated treatment effects. An event study around COVID-19 reveals that network fragility increased 24.5 percent post-shock, amplifying treatment effects through supply chain spillovers in a manner analogous to financial contagion documented in our recent study. Our framework provides micro-foundations for technology policy: interventions have spatial reach of 69 kilometers and network amplification factor of 10.8, requiring coordinated geographic and supply chain targeting for optimal effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>108 p...</summary><p>108 pages, 27 figures</p></details> |

However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.</p></details> |  |

We extend the Navier-Stokes-based approach from our previous studies to characterize contagion dynamics in the European banking system through the spectral properties of network evolution operators. Using high-quality bilateral exposure data from the European Banking Authority Transparency Exercise (2014-2023), we estimate the causal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on network fragility using spatial difference-in-differences methods adapted from our previous studies. Our empirical analysis reveals that COVID-19 elevated network fragility, measured by the algebraic connectivity $\lambda_2$ of the system Laplacian, by 26.9% above pre-pandemic levels (95% CI: [7.4%, 46.5%], p<0.05), with effects persisting through 2023. Paradoxically, this occurred despite a 46% reduction in the number of banks, demonstrating that consolidation increased systemic vulnerability by intensifying interconnectedness-consistent with theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Our findings validate the key predictions from \citet{kikuchi2024dynamical}: treatment effects amplify over time through spatial spillovers, consolidation increases fragility when coupling strength rises, and systems exhibit structural hysteresis preventing automatic reversion to pre-shock equilibria. The results demonstrate the empirical relevance of continuous functional methods for financial stability analysis and provide new insights for macroprudential policy design. We propose network-based capital requirements targeting spectral centrality and stress testing frameworks incorporating diffusion dynamics to address the coupling externalities identified in our analysis.</p></details> | 148 pages, 5 figures |

With the advent of deep learning, the LLIE technique has achieved significant breakthroughs. However, existing LLIE methods either ignore the important role of frequency domain information or fail to effectively promote the propagation and flow of information, limiting the LLIE performance. In this paper, we develop a novel frequency-spatial interaction-driven network (FSIDNet) for LLIE based on two-stage architecture. To be specific, the first stage is designed to restore the amplitude of low-light images to improve the lightness, and the second stage devotes to restore phase information to refine fine-grained structures. Considering that Frequency domain and spatial domain information are complementary and both favorable for LLIE, we further develop two frequency-spatial interaction blocks which mutually amalgamate the complementary spatial and frequency information to enhance the capability of the model. In addition, we construct the Information Exchange Module (IEM) to associate two stages by adequately incorporating cross-stage and cross-scale features to effectively promote the propagation and flow of information in the two-stage network structure. Finally, we conduct experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets (i.e., LOL-Real, LSRW-Huawei, etc.), which demonstrate that our method achieves the excellent performance in terms of visual results and quantitative metrics while preserving good model efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors, capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven approach.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Results show that SHAPE's SAEs are moderately consistent with BRFSS (average Pearson's correlation coefficient r of about 0.5), similar to CDC PLACES (average r of about 0.6), and are strongly aligned with CDC PLACES model-based estimates at both county (average r of about 0.8) and census tract (average r of about 0.7) levels. SHAPE is an open, reproducible, and transparent framework programmed in R that meets a need for accessible SAE methods in public health.</p></details> |  |

The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks, SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset (ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at https://github.com/aaronw5/SAL-T4HEP.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 Pa...</summary><p>44 Pages, 18 figures.

For instance, public health officials might be interested in whether air pollution has a strictly positive association with a health outcome, and the magnitude of any effect. Standard machine learning methods often provide accurate predictions but offer limited insight into covariate-response relationships. And we show that existing methods for constructing confidence (or credible) intervals for associations can fail to provide nominal coverage in the face of model misspecification and nonrandom locations - despite both being essentially always present in spatial problems. We introduce a method that constructs valid frequentist confidence intervals for associations in spatial settings. Our method requires minimal assumptions beyond a form of spatial smoothness and a homoskedastic Gaussian error assumption. In particular, we do not require model correctness or covariate overlap between training and target locations. Our approach is the first to guarantee nominal coverage in this setting and outperforms existing techniques in both real and simulated experiments. Our confidence intervals are valid in finite samples when the noise of the Gaussian error is known, and we provide an asymptotically consistent estimation procedure for this noise variance when it is unknown.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally; 39 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

While training methods and computational models have greatly advanced, SNNs struggle to achieve competitive performance in visual long-sequence modeling tasks. In artificial neural networks, the effective receptive field (ERF) serves as a valuable tool for analyzing feature extraction capabilities in visual long-sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Effective Receptive Field (ST-ERF) to analyze the ERF distributions across various Transformer-based SNNs. Based on the proposed ST-ERF, we reveal that these models suffer from establishing a robust global ST-ERF, thereby limiting their visual feature modeling capabilities. To overcome this issue, we propose two novel channel-mixer architectures: \underline{m}ulti-\underline{l}ayer-\underline{p}erceptron-based m\underline{ixer} (MLPixer) and \underline{s}plash-and-\underline{r}econstruct \underline{b}lock (SRB). These architectures enhance global spatial ERF through all timesteps in early network stages of Transformer-based SNNs, improving performance on challenging visual long-sequence modeling tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on the Meta-SDT variants and across object detection and semantic segmentation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Beyond these specific applications, we believe the proposed ST-ERF framework can provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing SNN architectures across a broader range of tasks.

Serving as specialized brain-inspired structures that encode spatial information and uncertainty, ring attractors explicitly encode the action space, facilitate the organization of neural activity, and enable the distribution of spatial representations across the neural network in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These structures also provide temporal filtering that stabilizes action selection during exploration, for example, by preserving the continuity between rotation angles in robotic control or adjacency between tactical moves in game-like environments. The application of ring attractors in the action selection process involves mapping actions to specific locations on the ring and decoding the selected action based on neural activity. We investigate the application of ring attractors by both building an exogenous model and integrating them as part of DRL agents. Our approach significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the Atari 100k benchmark, achieving a 53% increase in performance over selected baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

It provides spatially resolved gene expression data but often lacks cellular resolution, necessitating cell type deconvolution to infer cellular composition at each spatial location. In this paper we propose BASIN for cell type deconvolution, which models deconvolution as a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem incorporating graph Laplacian prior. Rather than find a deterministic optima like other recent methods, we propose a matrix variate Bayesian NMF method with nonnegativity and sparsity priors, in which the variables are maintained in their matrix form to derive a more efficient matrix normal posterior. BASIN employs a Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of cell type proportions and other parameters, offering a distribution of possible solutions, enhancing robustness and providing inherent uncertainty quantification. The performance of BASIN is evaluated on different spatial transcriptomics datasets and outperforms other deconvolution methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the effect of the incorporated priors and reflect a truncated matrix normal distribution as we expect.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |

Numerous approaches are proposed to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples, including advanced optimization, data augmentation, and model modifications. However, these methods still show limited transferability, particularly in cross-architecture scenarios, such as from CNN to ViT. To achieve high transferability, we propose a technique termed Spatial Adversarial Alignment (SAA), which employs an alignment loss and leverages a witness model to fine-tune the surrogate model. Specifically, SAA consists of two key parts: spatial-aware alignment and adversarial-aware alignment. First, we minimize the divergences of features between the two models in both global and local regions, facilitating spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a self-adversarial strategy that leverages adversarial examples to impose further constraints, aligning features from an adversarial perspective. Through this alignment, the surrogate model is trained to concentrate on the common features extracted by the witness model. This facilitates adversarial attacks on these shared features, thereby yielding perturbations that exhibit enhanced transferability. Extensive experiments on various architectures on ImageNet show that aligned surrogate models based on SAA can provide higher transferable adversarial examples, especially in cross-architecture attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark.

Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured, grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text, SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench, a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, \textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants: \textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic, \textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover, to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions, resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence, especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research toward human-like spatial intelligence.

The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree, which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the TCP has to be considered.

Rather than discrete treatment parameters, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as continuous functions $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous analysis of boundary evolution, spatial gradients, and cumulative exposure. Empirical validation using 32,520 U.S. ZIP codes demonstrates exponential spatial decay for healthcare access ($\kappa = 0.002837$ per km, $R^2 = 0.0129$) with detectable boundaries at 37.1 km. The framework successfully diagnoses when scope conditions hold: positive decay parameters validate diffusion assumptions near hospitals, while negative parameters correctly signal urban confounding effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals 2-13 $\times$ stronger distance effects for elderly populations and substantial education gradients. Model selection strongly favors logarithmic decay over exponential ($\Delta \text{AIC} > 10,000$), representing a middle ground between exponential and power-law decay. Applications span environmental economics, banking, and healthcare policy. The continuous functional framework provides predictive capability ($d^*(t) = \xi^* \sqrt{t}$), parameter sensitivity ($\partial d^*/\partial \nu$), and diagnostic tests unavailable in traditional difference-in-differences approaches.</p></details> | 65 pages, 10 figures |

The spatial dispersion, terrain variability, and agricultural labor dependencies that characterize rural aging experiences require moving beyond service-domain frameworks toward spatial stress assessment models. Current research on rural aging in China exhibits methodological gaps, systematically underrepresenting the spatial stressors that older adults face daily, including terrain barriers, infrastructure limitations, climate exposure, and agricultural labor burdens. Existing rural revitalization policies emphasize standardized interventions while inadequately addressing spatial heterogeneity and the spatially-differentiated needs of aging populations. This study developed a GIS-based spatial stress analysis framework that applies Lawton and Nahemow's competence-press model to quantify aging-related stressors and classify rural villages by intervention needs. Using data from 27 villages in Mamuchi Township, Shandong Province, we established four spatial stress indicators: slope gradient index (SGI), solar radiation exposure index (SREI), walkability index (WI), and agricultural intensity index (AII). Analysis of variance and hierarchical clustering revealed significant variation in spatial pressures across villages and identified distinct typologies that require targeted intervention strategies. The framework produces both quantitative stress measurements for individual villages and a classification system that groups villages with similar stress patterns, providing planners and policymakers with practical tools for designing spatially-targeted age-friendly interventions in rural China and similar contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript; forthcoming in Urban Studies</p></details> |

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |

The detection of spatially variable (SV) genes, which are molecular signatures with position-dependent expression, provides critical insights into disease mechanisms spanning oncology, neurology, and cardiovascular research. Current methodologies, however, confront dual constraints: predominant reliance on predefined spatial pattern templates restricts detection of novel complex spatial architectures, and inconsistent sample selection strategies compromise analytical stability and biological interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework incorporating non-parametric spatial modeling and across-sample integration. It takes advantage of the non-parametric technique and develops an adaptive spatial process accommodating complex pattern discovery while maintaining biological interpretability. A novel cross-sample bi-level shrinkage prior is further introduced for robust multi-sample SV gene detection, facilitating more effective information fusion. An efficient variational inference is developed for posterior inference ensuring computational scalability. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed method over existing analytical frameworks, and its application to DLPFC and SCC data reveals interpretable SV genes whose spatial patterns delineate relevant clusters and gradients, advancing human transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |

The models were tested on both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification, geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions, requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration. Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.</p></details> | 20 pages, 24 figures |

We present a novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline in our illustrative economic network. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2025. 5 pages, 1 figure.

However, their computational cost increases rapidly with the number of locations, potentially needing multiple hours even for moderate sample sizes. To address this, we propose using Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (SIVI), a highly flexible Bayesian approximation method, for scalable Bayesian spatial interpolation. We evaluated SIVI with a GP prior and a Nearest-Neighbour Gaussian Process (NNGP) prior compared to Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI), Pathfinder, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), the reference method in spatial statistics. Methods were compared based on their predictive ability measured by the CRPS, the interval score, and the negative log-predictive density across 50 replicates for both Gaussian and Poisson outcomes. SIVI-based methods achieved similar results to HMC, while being drastically faster. On average, for the Poisson scenario with 500 training locations, SIVI reduced the computational time from roughly 6 hours for HMC to 130 seconds. Furthermore, SIVI-NNGP analyzed a simulated land surface temperature dataset of 150,000 locations while estimating all unknown model parameters in under two minutes. These results highlight the potential of SIVI as a flexible and scalable inference technique in spatial statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the EUSIPCO 2025 conference; corrected typo in equation (3)</p></details> |

They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/MV-RoboBench</p></details> |

However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |

However, such spatial sparsity of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026 Conference Submission</p></details> |

This class of technologies has enabled the investigation of the spatial variation of gene expressions and their impact on specific biological processes. Identifying genes with similar expression profiles is of utmost importance, thus motivating the development of flexible methods leveraging spatial data structure to cluster genes. Here, we propose a modeling framework for clustering observations measured over numerous spatial locations via Gaussian processes. Rather than specifying their covariance kernels as a function of the spatial structure, we use it to inform a generalized Cholesky decomposition of their precision matrices. This approach prevents issues with kernel misspecification and facilitates the estimation of a non-stationarity spatial covariance structure. Applied to spatial transcriptomic data, our model identifies gene clusters with distinctive spatial correlation patterns across tissue areas comprising different cell types, like tumoral and stromal areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in Journal of Classification</p></details> |

Although vision-language models (VLMs) and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models' reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with dynamic spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, representations within most machine learning models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs. We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the organization of linguistic information in the human brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Workshop on Representational Alignment (Re-Align) Camera Ready</p></details> |

While KV cache compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware.</p></details> |  |

When managing such data, spatial database systems offer various index options and data formats, e.g., point-based or trajectory-based. Likewise, dataset characteristics such as geographic overlap and skew can vary significantly. All three significantly affect database performance. While this has been studied in existing papers, none of them explore the effects and trade-offs resulting from a combination of all three aspects. In this paper, we evaluate the performance impact of index choice, data format, and dataset characteristics on a popular spatial database system, PostGIS. We focus on two aspects of dataset characteristics, the degree of overlap and the degree of skew, and propose novel approximation methods to determine these features. We design a benchmark that compares a variety of spatial indexing strategies and data formats, while also considering the impact of dataset characteristics on database performance. We include a variety of real-world and synthetic datasets, write operations, and read queries to cover a broad range of scenarios that might occur during application runtime.

Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at https://github.com/zhangquanchen/3DThinker.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, automatic traffic detectors across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals, providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima. Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.</p></details> |  |

To capture this complexity and account for spatial dependencies across small areas, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates non-linear functions with the Besag, York, and Mollie (BYM2) model. Applying this framework to all-cause mortality data in Switzerland, we quantified spatial inequalities in heat-related mortality. We retrieved daily all-cause mortality at small areas (2,145 municipalities) for people older than 65 years from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and daily mean temperature at 1km$\times$1km grid from the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology. By fully propagating uncertainties, we derived key epidemiological metrics, including heat-related excess mortality and minimum mortality temperature (MMT). Heat-related excess mortality rates were higher in northern Switzerland, while lower MMTs were observed in mountainous regions. Further, we explored the role of the proportion of individuals older than 85 years, green space, average temperature, deprivation, urbanicity, air pollution, and language regions in explaining these discrepancies. We found that spatial disparities in heat-related excess mortality were primarily driven by population age distribution, green space, and vulnerabilities associated with elevated temperature exposure.</p></details> |  |

Each agent is assigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or self-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system. Building on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT framework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its social interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby avoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a socially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The proposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is computationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through simulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing high-fidelity avatars from single-view video sequences poses challenges due to limited visual and geometric data. To address these limitations, at the data level, our method leverages two types of data captured with smartphones: static pose sequences for texture reconstruction and dynamic motion sequences for learning pose-dependent deformations and lighting changes. At the representation level, we employ a lightweight yet expressive representation to reconstruct high-fidelity digital humans from sparse monocular data. We extract garment meshes from monocular data to model clothing deformations effectively, and attach illumination-aware Gaussians to the mesh surface, enabling high-fidelity rendering and capturing pose-dependent lighting. This representation efficiently learns high-resolution and dynamic information from monocular data, enabling the creation of detailed avatars. At the rendering level, real-time performance is critical for animating high-fidelity avatars in AR/VR, social gaming, and on-device creation. Our GPU-driven rendering pipeline delivers 120 FPS on mobile devices and 90 FPS on standalone VR devices at 2K resolution, over $2.7\times$ faster than representative mobile-engine baselines. Experiments show that HRM$^2$Avatar delivers superior visual realism and real-time interactivity, outperforming state-of-the-art monocular methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2025, Project Page: https://acennr-engine.github.io/HRM2Avatar</p></details> |

Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries. To address this limitation, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can produce correct answers after multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated one through Majority Voting. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising reinforcement learning approach for improving model alignment. We argue that ORMs could serve as an effective new test-time heuristic, although their application in this context remains largely underexplored. In this work, we propose a unified framework for training ORMs tailored to the Text-to-SQL task and assess their effectiveness as a test-time heuristic within the BoN strategy. We benchmark ORMs against ex-BoN and Maj across the BIRD and Spider datasets, fine-tuning diverse open-source LLMs from the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 families. Results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations.

In this work, we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion) scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

However, the pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.</p></details> |  |

This becomes even more challenging when the object to be handled is a container filled with liquid. This paper addresses the task of transporting a liquid-filled cup placed on a tray along a prescribed path in shortest time. The objective is to minimize swapping, thus avoiding spillage of the fluid. To this end, the sloshing dynamics is incorporated into the dynamic model used within the optimal control problem formulation.

Unlike our other works, here the damping effect in agent dynamics is included. First, the attainable set for each agent with fuel budget constraints is characterized, and its boundary equations are derived. Then, using the convexity property, the minimum time at which attainable sets of all agents have a non-empty intersection is computed. By applying Helly's theorem, the computation reduces to finding the minimum time to consensus and the corresponding consensus point for each of the triplets separately.</p></details> |  |

This paper fills the gap by introducing a novel representation-based transfer learning framework for vector autoregressive models, and information from related source datasets with rich observations can be leveraged to enhance estimation efficiency through representation learning. A two-stage regularized estimation procedure is proposed with well established non-asymptotic properties, and algorithms with alternating updates are suggested to search for the estimates. Our transfer learning framework can handle time series with varying sample sizes and asynchronous starting and/or ending time points, thereby offering remarkable flexibility in integrating information from diverse datasets. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology, and its usefulness is demonstrated by an empirical analysis on 20 macroeconomic variables from Japan and another nine countries.</p></details> |  |

The installation employs SpecMaskGIT, a lightweight yet high-quality sound generation AI model, to generate and playback eight-channel sound in real-time, creating an immersive auditory experience over the course of a three-month exhibition. The work is grounded in the concept of a "new form of archive," which aims to preserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists' past artworks by continued generation of new sound elements. This speculative approach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the AI model on a dataset consisting of over 200 hours of Evala's past sound artworks. By addressing key requirements in the co-creation of art using AI, this study highlights the value of the following aspects: (1) the necessity of integrating artist feedback, (2) datasets derived from an artist's past works, and (3) ensuring the inclusion of unexpected, novel outputs. In Studies for, the model was designed to reflect the artist's artistic identity while generating new, previously unheard sounds, making it a fitting realization of the concept of "a new form of archive." We propose a Human-AI co-creation framework for effectively incorporating sound generation AI models into the sound art creation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound art that extend an artist's work beyond their physical existence.

Due to the extreme complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies such as mobile crowdsensing suffer from weak environmental adaptability, insufficient professional sensing capabilities, and poor practicality of sensing solutions. Therefore, this paper explores a heterogeneous multi-agent online collaborative scheduling algorithm, HoCs-MPQ, to achieve efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information. HoCs-MPQ models collaboration and conflict relationships among multiple elements through weighted undirected graph construction, and iteratively solves the maximum weight independent set based on multi-priority queues, ultimately achieving collaborative sensing scheduling of time-dependent UA Vs, vehicles, and workers. Specifically, (1) HoCs-MPQ constructs weighted undirected graph nodes based on collaborative relationships among multiple elements and quantifies their weights, then models the weighted undirected graph based on conflict relationships between nodes; (2) HoCs-MPQ solves the maximum weight independent set based on iterated local search, and accelerates the solution process using multi-priority queues. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and simulated data. The experiments show that, compared to baseline methods (e.g., HoCs-GREEDY, HoCs-K-WTA, HoCs-MADL, and HoCs-MARL), HoCs-MPQ improves task completion rates by an average of 54.13%, 23.82%, 14.12%, and 12.89% respectively, with computation time for single online autonomous scheduling decisions not exceeding 3 seconds.</p></details> |  |

While many self-indexes have been proposed, developing dynamically updatable ones supporting string insertions and deletions remains a challenge. The r-index (Gagie et al., JACM'20) is a representative static self-index based on the run-length Burrows-Wheeler transform (RLBWT), designed for highly repetitive strings. We present the dynamic r-index, a dynamic extension of the r-index that achieves updates in LCP-bounded time. The dynamic r-index supports count queries in $O(m \log r / \log \log r)$ time and locate queries in $O(m \log r / \log \log r + \mathsf{occ} \log r)$ time, using $O(r)$ words of space, where $m$ is the length of a query with $\mathsf{occ}$ occurrences and $r$ is the number of runs in the RLBWT. Crucially, update operations are supported in $O((m + L_{\mathsf{max}}) \log n)$ time for a substring of length $m$, where $L_{\mathsf{max}}$ is the maximum LCP value; the average running time is $O((m + L_{\mathsf{avg}}) \log n)$, where $L_{\mathsf{avg}}$ is the average LCP value. This LCP-bounded complexity is particularly advantageous for highly repetitive strings where LCP values are typically small. We experimentally demonstrate the practical efficiency of the dynamic r-index on various highly repetitive datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>I fix...</summary><p>I fixed the abstract so that it is now displayed correctly in Chrome</p></details> |

However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and (2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations. Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch. Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data.

Traditional reconstruction methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated, consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware, opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, will be updated</p></details> |

However, blockchain applications incentivize validators to play timing games by strategically delaying their proposals, since increased block time correlates with greater rewards. Consequently, it may appear that responsiveness (even under optimistic conditions) is impossible in blockchain protocols. In this work, we develop a model of timing games in responsive consensus protocols and find a prisoner's dilemma structure, where cooperation (proposing promptly) is in the validators' best interest, but individual incentives encourage validators to delay proposals selfishly. To attain desirable equilibria, we introduce dynamic block rewards that decrease with round time to explicitly incentivize faster proposals. Delays are measured through a voting mechanism, where other validators vote on the current leader's round time. By carefully setting the protocol parameters, the voting mechanism allows validators to coordinate and reach the cooperative equilibrium, benefiting all through a higher rate-of-reward. Thus, instead of responsiveness being an unattainable property due to timing games, we show that responsiveness itself can promote faster block proposals. One consequence of moving from a static to dynamic block reward is that validator utilities become more sensitive to latency, worsening the gap between the best- and worst-connected validators. Our analysis shows, however, that this effect is minor in both theoretical latency models and simulations based on real-world networks.</p></details> | 36 pages, 6 figures |

Lossy compression is considered a promising approach to reducing these data because lossless compression yields low compression ratios that barely mitigate the problem. However, directly applying existing lossy compression methods to timevarying vector fields may introduce undesired distortions in critical-point trajectories, a crucial feature that encodes key properties of the vector field. In this work, we propose an efficient lossy compression framework that exactly preserves all critical-point trajectories in time-varying vector fields. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend the theory for preserving critical points in space to preserving critical-point trajectories in space-time, and develop a compression framework to realize the functionality. Second, we propose a semi-Lagrange predictor to exploit the spatiotemporal correlations in advectiondominated regions, and combine it with the traditional Lorenzo predictor for improved compression efficiency. Third, we evaluate our method against state-of-the-art lossy and lossless compressors using four real-world scientific datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers up to 124.48X compression ratios while effectively preserving all critical-point trajectories. This compression ratio is up to 56.07X higher than that of the best lossless compressors, and none of the existing lossy compressors can preserve all critical-point trajectories at similar compression ratios.</p></details> |  |

To compensate for a quasiperiodic disturbance, a quasiperiodic disturbance observer using time delays was proposed. Its sensitivity function avoids the sensitivity tradeoff, achieving wideband harmonic suppression without amplifying aperiodic disturbances or shifting harmonic suppression frequencies. However, its open-loop transfer function is not rational and does not satisfy the assumptions of existing Bode sensitivity integrals due to its time delays. This paper provides Bode-like sensitivity integrals for the quasiperiodic disturbance observer in both continuous-time and discrete-time representations and clarifies the avoided sensitivity tradeoff with time delays.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to systems with high-dimensional input-output mappings arising from large numbers of spatial and temporal collocation points, these models often require heavily overparameterized networks, leading to long training times. Latent DeepONet addresses some of these challenges by introducing a two-step approach: first learning a reduced latent space using a separate model, followed by operator learning within this latent space. While efficient, this method is inherently data-driven and lacks mechanisms for incorporating physical laws, limiting its robustness and generalizability in data-scarce settings. In this work, we propose PI-Latent-NO, a physics-informed latent neural operator framework that integrates governing physics directly into the learning process. Our architecture features two coupled DeepONets trained end-to-end: a Latent-DeepONet that learns a low-dimensional representation of the solution, and a Reconstruction-DeepONet that maps this latent representation back to the physical space. By embedding PDE constraints into the training via automatic differentiation, our method eliminates the need for labeled training data and ensures physics-consistent predictions. The proposed framework is both memory and compute-efficient, exhibiting near-constant scaling with problem size and demonstrating significant speedups over traditional physics-informed operator models. We validate our approach on a range of parametric PDEs, showcasing its accuracy, scalability, and suitability for real-time prediction in complex physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Ordering for Structure Learning From Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24639v1)** | 2025-10-28 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24639v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods. Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph $F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery.</p></details> | 32 pages |

In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video captioning framework named Retrieval-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (RETTA), which takes advantage of existing pretrained large-scale vision and language models to directly generate captions with test-time adaptation. Specifically, we bridge video and text using four key models: a general video-text retrieval model XCLIP, a general image-text matching model CLIP, a text alignment model AnglE, and a text generation model GPT-2, due to their source-code availability. The main challenge is how to enable the text generation model to be sufficiently aware of the content in a given video so as to generate corresponding captions. To address this problem, we propose using learnable tokens as a communication medium among these four frozen models GPT-2, XCLIP, CLIP, and AnglE. Different from the conventional way that trains these tokens with training data, we propose to learn these tokens with soft targets of the inference data under several carefully crafted loss functions, which enable the tokens to absorb video information catered for GPT-2. This procedure can be efficiently done in just a few iterations (we use 16 iterations in the experiments) and does not require ground truth data. Extensive experimental results on three widely used datasets, MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX, show absolute 5.1%-32.4% improvements in terms of the main metric CIDEr compared to several state-of-the-art zero-shot video captioning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |

Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.</p></details> | 25 pages |

The standard direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training. Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

Existing approaches, however, either rely on strong structural assumptions or fail to handle key challenges such as interference, spatial confounding, temporal carryover, and time-varying confounding -- where covariates are influenced by past treatments and, in turn, affect future ones. We introduce GST-UNet (G-computation Spatio-Temporal UNet), a theoretically grounded neural framework that combines a U-Net-based spatiotemporal encoder with regression-based iterative G-computation to estimate location-specific potential outcomes under complex intervention sequences. GST-UNet explicitly adjusts for time-varying confounders and captures non-linear spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling valid causal inference from a single observed trajectory in data-scarce settings. We validate its effectiveness in synthetic experiments and in a real-world analysis of wildfire smoke exposure and respiratory hospitalizations during the 2018 California Camp Fire. Together, these results position GST-UNet as a principled and ready-to-use framework for spatiotemporal causal inference, advancing reliable estimation in policy-relevant and scientific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Crucial tools in the a priori analysis for the fully-discrete formulation are the design of suitable projection and interpolation operators extending those used in the parabolic setting, and stability estimates based on a nonstandard choice of the test function; a priori estimates are shown, which are measured in $L^\infty$-type norms in time. For the semi-discrete in time formulation, we exhibit reliable a posteriori error estimates for the error measured in the $L^\infty(L^2)$ norm with fully explicit constants; to this aim, we design a reconstruction operator into $\mathcal C^1$ piecewise polynomials over the time grid with optimal approximation properties in terms of the polynomial degree distribution and the time steps. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

Looped transformers save on parameters by reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However, this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop. This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques. First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache) from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.</p></details> |  |

Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies, and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features. The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing.</p></details> |  |

The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series.

We leverage probabilistic models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments, we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods, and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately forecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically; and (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate business insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these two challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time series models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The model has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of the time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies, which enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made to each module, and a unified framework is established to address both forecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy, its comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting repository shows superior performance over not only well-established statistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer neural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms of infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in Google Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious technicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically scales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it possible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a throughput of more than 18000 time series per second. In terms of interpretability, we present several case studies to demonstrate time series insights it generates and customizability it offers.</p></details> |  |

Equivalently, the problem asks if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$, each inducing a connected subgraph, such that contracting each subgraph into a single vertex results in $H$. It is known that $H$-IMC is NP-complete for several graphs $H$, even when $H$ is a tree. In this work, we investigate which properties of $H$ guarantee the existence of an induced minor model whose structure can be leveraged to solve the problem in polynomial time. This allows us to identify four infinite families of graphs $H$ that enjoy such properties. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</p></details> |  |

The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |

This substantially improves the working space compared to standard implementations of Hierholzer's algorithm, which use $\mathrm{O}(m \lg n)$ bits of space. Our algorithm runs in linear time, like the classical versions, but avoids an $\mathrm{O}(m)$-size stack of vertices or storing information for each edge. To our knowledge, this is the first linear-time algorithm to achieve this space bound, and the method is very easy to implement. The correctness argument, by contrast, is surprisingly subtle; we give a detailed formal proof. The space savings are particularly relevant for dense graphs or multigraphs with large edge multiplicities.</p></details> |  |

Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations, including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled, disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding, where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances.

Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

It has important applications in spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$ variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects $m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2) prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and model optimization.</p></details> | In submission |

Best-of-N reformulation over the generated candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability. However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks remain constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness, understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07, while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile, LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing methods in single editing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page:https://mined-lmm.github.io/</p></details> |

We study the problem of estimating continuous-time dynamics from such snapshots. We present Continuous-Time Optimal Transport Flow (CT-OT Flow), a two-stage framework that (i) infers high-resolution time labels by aligning neighboring intervals via partial optimal transport (POT) and (ii) reconstructs a continuous-time data distribution through temporal kernel smoothing, from which we sample pairs of nearby times to train standard ODE/SDE models. Our formulation explicitly accounts for snapshot aggregation and time-label uncertainty and uses practical accelerations (screening and mini-batch POT), making it applicable to large datasets. Across synthetic benchmarks and two real datasets (scRNA-seq and typhoon tracks), CT-OT Flow reduces distributional and trajectory errors compared with OT-CFM, [SF]\(^{2}\)M, TrajectoryNet, MFM, and ENOT.</p></details> |  |

While modern supercomputing scientific codes achieve exascale performance by leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs), existing GPU-based compressible combustion solvers face critical limitations in memory management, load balancing, and handling the highly localized nature of chemical reactions. To this end, we present a high-performance compressible reacting flow solver built on the AMReX framework and optimized for multi-GPU settings. Our approach addresses three GPU performance bottlenecks: memory access patterns through column-major storage optimization, computational workload variability via a bulk-sparse integration strategy for chemical kinetics, and multi-GPU load distribution for adaptive mesh refinement applications. The solver adapts existing matrix-based chemical kinetics formulations to multigrid contexts. Using representative combustion applications including hydrogen-air detonations and jet in supersonic crossflow configurations, we demonstrate $2-5\times$ performance improvements over initial GPU implementations with near-ideal weak scaling across $1-96$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Roofline analysis reveals substantial improvements in arithmetic intensity for both convection ($\sim 10 \times$) and chemistry ($\sim 4 \times$) routines, confirming efficient utilization of GPU memory bandwidth and computational resources.</p></details> | 32 pages, 12 figures |

However, in the case of scattering by trapping obstacles, the Helmholtz solution exhibits nearly-real complex resonances -- which significantly slows the convergence of numerical inverse transform. To address this difficulty this paper introduces a frequency-domain singularity subtraction technique that regularizes the integrand of the inverse transform and efficiently computes the singularity contribution via a combination of a straightforward and inexpensive numerical technique together with a large-time asymptotic expansion. Crucially, all relevant complex resonances and their residues are determined via rational approximation of integral equation solutions at real frequencies. An adaptive algorithm is employed to ensure that all relevant complex resonances are properly identified.</p></details> |  |

To remain consistent with existing market structures, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) have advanced the aggregation of transmission-node-level DERs (T-DERs), where a nodal virtual power plant (VPP) represents the mapping of all distribution-level DERs to their respective transmission nodes. This paper develops a real-time economic dispatch (RTED) framework that enables multi-transmission-node DER aggregation while addressing computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for adaptive prediction of distribution factors (DFs), thereby capturing the dynamic influence of individual T-DERs across the transmission system. Furthermore, an iterative constraint identification strategy is incorporated to alleviate transmission security constraints without compromising system reliability. Together, these innovations accelerate the market clearing process and support the effective participation of T-DER aggregators under current market paradigms. The proposed approach is validated on large-scale test systems, including modified 118-, 2383-, and 3012-bus networks under a rolling RTED setting with real demand data. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in reducing operational costs and maintaining transmission network feasibility, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

While promising, transformers' computational cost scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the significant performance improvements. We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to linear ($O(N)$). Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Temporal Blindness in Multi-Turn LLM Agents: Misaligned Tool Use vs. Human Time Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23853v1)** | 2025-10-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.23853v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge, we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across 34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples, creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call (prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive, prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with human temporal perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>preli...</summary><p>preliminary work in progress</p></details> |

However, diagnosing solely from these sounds is often challenging due to interference from surrounding noise, and the information may be limited. Existing solutions that adaptively cancel external noise are either not real-time or are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for implementation in a portable system. This work proposes an end-to-end system with a real-time adaptive noise cancellation pipeline integrated into a device that simultaneously acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The performance of the system is validated using real-world hospital noise datasets and recordings captured with the dual-modality device. For PCG and ECG signals recorded from the device in noisy hospital settings, the proposed algorithms achieved signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 37.01 dB and 30.32 dB, respectively. These results demonstrate the systems effectiveness in enabling reliable and accessible cardiac screening, including noisy hospital environments typical of resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) 2026</p></details> |

We present the first AI-enabled mmWave system for contactless multi-site PTT measurement using a single radar. By leveraging radar beamforming and deep learning algorithms our system simultaneously measures PTT and estimates diastolic blood pressure at multiple sites. The system was evaluated across three physiological pathways - heart-to-radial artery, heart-to-carotid artery, and mastoid area-to-radial artery -- achieving correlation coefficients of 0.73-0.89 compared to contact-based reference sensors for measuring PTT. Furthermore, the system demonstrated correlation coefficients of 0.90-0.92 for estimating DBP, and achieved a mean error of -1.00-0.62 mmHg and standard deviation of 4.97-5.70 mmHg, meeting the FDA's AAMI guidelines for non-invasive blood pressure monitors. These results suggest that our proposed system has the potential to provide a non-invasive measure of cardiovascular health across multiple regions of the body.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods rely on database matching from previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning, enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap, enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively. Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate, providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable identification.</p></details> |  |

Given a fractional assignment $\vec x$ of values to edges of graph $G = (U \cup V, E)$, the algorithms return an integral solution $\vec X$ such that each right-node $v \in V$ has at most one neighboring edge $f$ with $X_f = 1$, and the variables $X_e$ also satisfy broad nonpositive-correlation properties. In particular, for any edges $e_1, e_2$ sharing a left-node $u \in U$, the variables $X_{e_1}, X_{e_2}$ have strong negative correlation, i.e. the expectation of $X_{e_1} X_{e_2}$ is significantly below $x_{e_1} x_{e_2}$. This algorithm is based on generating negatively-correlated Exponential random variables and using them in a contention-resolution scheme inspired by an algorithm Im & Shadloo (2020). Our algorithm gives stronger and much more flexible negative correlation properties. Dependent rounding schemes with negative correlation properties have been used for approximation algorithms for job-scheduling on unrelated machines to minimize weighted completion times (Bansal, Srinivasan, & Svensson (2021), Im & Shadloo (2020), Im & Li (2023)). Using our new dependent-rounding algorithm, among other improvements, we obtain a $1.398$-approximation for this problem. This significantly improves over the prior $1.45$-approximation ratio of Im & Li (2023).</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks assess only end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail. We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench, which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates. Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.</p></details> |  |

Lossy compression is considered a promising approach to reducing these data because lossless compression yields low compression ratios that barely mitigate the problem. However, directly applying existing lossy compression methods to timevarying vector fields may introduce undesired distortions in critical-point trajectories, a crucial feature that encodes key properties of the vector field. In this work, we propose an efficient lossy compression framework that exactly preserves all critical-point trajectories in time-varying vector fields. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend the theory for preserving critical points in space to preserving critical-point trajectories in space-time, and develop a compression framework to realize the functionality. Second, we propose a semi-Lagrange predictor to exploit the spatiotemporal correlations in advectiondominated regions, and combine it with the traditional Lorenzo predictor for improved compression efficiency. Third, we evaluate our method against state-of-the-art lossy and lossless compressors using four real-world scientific datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers up to 124.48X compression ratios while effectively preserving all critical-point trajectories. This compression ratio is up to 56.07X higher than that of the best lossless compressors, and none of the existing lossy compressors can preserve all critical-point trajectories at similar compression ratios.</p></details> |  |

Simulation offers scalability but suffers from sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning. Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines, while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data collection.

Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors, fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.</p></details> |  |

In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data. ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable actions and rewards.

In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS.

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, an agent framework powered by large language models, designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on five tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajAgent in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38%-69.91% over baseline methods.

| **[Predicting Barge Tow Size on Inland Waterways Using Vessel Trajectory Derived Features: Proof of Concept](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23994v1)** | 2025-10-28 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.23994v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30 AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches, were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with differing operational and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905v1)** | 2025-10-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.23905v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN (for group intent inference).</p></details> |  |

A 64-element Massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MaMIMO) array was used to capture channels for three trajectories of an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV), including two horizontal zig-zag flights at fixed altitudes and one vertical ascent, chosen to emulate AUE operations and to induce controlled azimuth and elevation sweeps for analyzing geometry-dependent propagation dynamics. We examine large-scale power variations and their correlation with geometric features, such as elevation, azimuth, and 3D distance, followed by an analysis of fading behavior through distribution fitting and Rician K-factor estimation. Furthermore, temporal non-stationarity is quantified using the Correlation Matrix Distance (CMD), and angular stationarity spans are utilized to demonstrate how channel characteristics change with the movement of the UAV. We also analyze Spectral Efficiency (SE) in relation to K-factor and Root Mean Square (RMS) delay spread, highlighting their combined influence on link performance. The results show that the elevation angle is the strongest predictor of the received power, with a correlation of more than 0.77 for each trajectory, while the Nakagami model best fits the small-scale fading. The K-factor increases from approximately 5 dB at low altitudes to over 15 dB at higher elevations, indicating stronger LoS dominance. Non-stationarity patterns are highly trajectory- and geometry-dependent, with azimuth most affected in horizontal flights and elevation during vertical flight. These findings offer valuable insights for modeling and improving UAV communication channels in 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (IEEE TVT)</p></details> |

Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force, velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation, yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback, and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication in IEEE</p></details> |

The capability to flexibly adjust the relative position between the multirotor and the payload has spurred growing interest in the system equipped with variable-length cable, promising broader application potential. Compared to systems with fixed-length cables, introducing the variable-length cable adds a new degree of freedom. However, it also results in increased nonlinearity and more complex dynamic coupling among the multirotor, the cable and the payload, posing significant challenges in control design. This paper introduces a backstepping control strategy tailored for aerial transportation systems with variable-length cable, designed to precisely track the payload trajectory while dynamically adjusting cable length. Then, a cable length generator has been developed that achieves online optimization of the cable length while satisfying state constraints, thus balancing the multirotor's motion and cable length changes without the need for manual trajectory planning. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed through Lyapunov techniques and the growth restriction condition. Finally, simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in managing trajectory tracking and cable length adjustments effectively.</p></details> |  |

However, the uncertain task sizes and high mobility of UAVs pose great challenges to guarantee the quality of service. To address these issues, we propose an LAN architecture where UAVs and HAPs collaboratively provide computation offloading for ground users. Moreover, the uncertainty sets are constructed to characterize the uncertain task size, and a distributionally robust optimization problem is formulated to minimize the worst-case delay by jointly optimizing the offloading decisions and UAV trajectories. To solve the mixed-integer min-max optimization problem, we design the distributionally robust computation offloading and trajectories optimization algorithm. Specifically, the original problem is figured out by iteratively solving the outerlayer and inner-layer problems. The convex outer-layer problem with probability distributions is solved by the optimization toolkit. As for the inner-layer mixed-integer problem, we employ the Benders decomposition. The decoupled master problem concerning the binary offloading decisions is solved by the integer solver, and UAV trajectories in the sub-problem are optimized via the successive convex approximation. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional optimization methods in balancing the worst-case delay and robustness.</p></details> |  |

They were originally developed to transfer such learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete. Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical probe before fine-tuning or deployment.</p></details> |  |

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we address the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems with unknown dynamics. We propose a hierarchical planning framework that enables zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks by leveraging only task-agnostic trajectory data during offline training. The framework consists of three key components: (i) decomposing the STL specification into several progresses and time constraints, (ii) searching for timed waypoints that satisfy all progresses under time constraints, and (iii) generating trajectory segments using a pre-trained diffusion model and stitching them into complete trajectories. We formally prove that our method guarantees STL satisfaction, and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating dynamically feasible trajectories across diverse long-horizon STL tasks.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by some recent works that have proposed effective algorithms, based on Polyak's heavy ball method and the Nesterov accelerated gradient method, to achieve convergence to a local minimum of nonconvex functions, this work proposes a broad class of Nesterov-type accelerated methods and puts forth a rigorous study of these methods encompassing the escape from saddle points and convergence to local minima through both an asymptotic and a non-asymptotic analysis. In the asymptotic regime, this paper answers an open question of whether Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) with variable momentum parameter avoids strict saddle points almost surely. This work also develops two metrics of asymptotic rates of convergence and divergence, and evaluates these two metrics for several popular standard accelerated methods such as the NAG and Nesterov's accelerated gradient with constant momentum (NCM) near strict saddle points. In the non-asymptotic regime, this work provides an analysis that leads to the "linear" exit time estimates from strict saddle neighborhoods for trajectories of these accelerated methods as well the necessary conditions for the existence of such trajectories. Finally, this work studies a sub-class of accelerated methods that can converge in convex neighborhoods of nonconvex functions with a near optimal rate to a local minimum and at the same time this sub-class offers superior saddle-escape behavior compared to that of NAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>122 p...</summary><p>122 pages, 20 figures; accepted for publication in Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM)</p></details> |

Predicting the future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns, they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions. TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3 m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m). Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Recently, machine learning (ML) approaches, particularly neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), have emerged as a powerful tool for data-driven modeling of continuous-time dynamics. Nevertheless, standard NODEs require a large number of data samples to remain consistent under varying control inputs, posing challenges to generate sufficient simulated data and ensure the safety of control design. To address this gap, we propose trajectory-sensitivity-aware (TRASE-)NODEs, which construct an augmented system for both state and sensitivity, enabling simultaneous learning of their dynamics. This formulation allows the adjoint method to update gradients in a memory-efficient manner and ensures that control-input effects are captured in the learned dynamics. We evaluate TRASE-NODEs using damped oscillator and inverter-based resources (IBRs). The results show that TRASE-NODEs generalize better from the limited training data, yielding lower prediction errors than standard NODEs for both examples. The proposed framework offers a data-efficient, control-oriented modeling approach suitable for dynamic systems that require accurate trajectory sensitivity prediction.</p></details> |  |

In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Indian Control Conference</p></details> |

However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. In addition, our framework can successfully adapt to and improve reasoning datasets represented by AIME-2024.

A neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two (parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The results confirm the validity of this approach.</p></details> |  |

This approach is beneficial if it is easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines. The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree, which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.</p></details> |  |

In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters. Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding, enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20% validation), the model aligns closely with ground truth -- 89.44% stepwise accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6 with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60 language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate, reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning and sequence-based learning and providing a practical foundation for general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, their application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment, derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop, ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

We present WebGraphEval, a framework that abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models</p></details> |

One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.</p></details> |  |

The optimization problem is posed in the likeness of a multiple-shooting approach, aiming for segment-to-segment continuity while tracking proximity to the original CR3BP structures. The analysis of various formulations leads to the selection of an unconstrained least-squares problem for further investigation. The nonlinear optimization problem is convexified and the use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as an alternative to the minimum-norm update equation found in most literature, is investigated for its control over the update step and inherent robustness. Additional techniques such as adaptive weighting are employed to further consolidate the behavior of the proposed algorithm in challenging scenarios. Numerical trials evaluate the adequacy of the methodology presented and compare it to the minimum-norm baseline over various application cases, including the generation of quasi-periodic trajectories and orbital transfers between them. The proposed approach is found to outperform the baseline in applications where the initial guess is poor and the ease of including proximity constraints provides benefits in control over the shape of the converged solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Advances in Space Research</p></details> |

Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

To contain the computational cost and facilitate data visualization, both MD and FD computations were done in two space dimensions. The MD argon trajectories were binned to the FD grid, and the optimal diffusion coefficient was estimated by minimizing the difference between the binned MD data and the FD solution with a nonlinear least squares procedure (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm).

In stochastic models every simulation is run with a specific parameter set and an implicit or explicit random seed, where each parameter set and random seed combination generates an individual realization, or trajectory, sampled from an underlying random process. Existing BO approaches typically rely on summary statistics over the realizations, such as means, medians, or quantiles, potentially limiting their effectiveness when trajectory-level information is desired. We propose a trajectory-oriented Bayesian optimization method that incorporates a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate using both input parameters and random seeds as inputs, enabling direct inference at the trajectory level. Using a common random number (CRN) approach, we define a surrogate-based likelihood over trajectories and introduce an adaptive Thompson Sampling algorithm that refines a fixed-size input grid through likelihood-based filtering and Metropolis-Hastings-based densification. This approach concentrates computation on statistically promising regions of the input space while balancing exploration and exploitation. We apply the method to stochastic epidemic models, a simple compartmental and a more computationally demanding agent-based model, demonstrating improved sampling efficiency and faster identification of data-consistent trajectories relative to parameter-only inference.</p></details> |  |

Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</p></details> |  |

By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this, we introduce a structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN) paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi- mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive anomalies (66.8%).

Their sampling process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}. The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance (VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models.

We introduce the notion of Free Configuration Space Uniformity (C-Free-Uniform for short) which has two key features: (i) it generates a control input distribution so as to uniformly sample the free configuration space, and (ii) in contrast to previously introduced trajectory sampling mechanisms where the distribution p(u | x) is independent of the environment, C-Free-Uniform is explicitly conditioned on the current local map. Next, we integrate this sampler into a new Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Controller, CFU-MPPI. Experiments show that CFU-MPPI outperforms existing methods in terms of success rate in challenging navigation tasks in cluttered polygonal environments while requiring a much smaller sampling budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results.

However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Main Track</p></details> |

While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been proposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion planning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed obstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT (Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning framework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly incorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our method is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a unified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed) and potential obstacles. This belief is further processed through a collision-aware inference mechanism that transforms spatial uncertainty and trajectory proximity into a time-varying observation urgency map. By integrating urgency values within the current field of view, we define differentiable objectives that enable real-time, observation-aware trajectory planning with computation times under 10 ms. Simulation and real-world experiments in dynamic, cluttered, and occluded environments show that our method detects potential dynamic obstacles 2.8 seconds earlier than baseline approaches, increasing dynamic obstacle visibility by over 500\%, and enabling safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |

These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets.

This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations, significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot systems in real-world applications.

| **[How can methods for classifying and clustering trajectories be used for prevention trials? An example in Alzheimer's disease area](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24751v1)** | 2025-10-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24751v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Clinical trials are designed to prove the efficacy of an intervention by means of model-based approaches involving parametric hypothesis testing. Issues arise when no effect is observed in the study population. Indeed, an effect may be present in a subgroup and the statistical test cannot detect it. To investigate this possibility, we proposed to change the paradigm to a data-driven approach. We selected exploratory methods to provide another perspective on the data and to identify particular homogeneous subgroups of subjects within which an effect might be detected. In the setting of prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures. In the settings of prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures, which requires the use of methods that can take data autocorrelation into account. The primary aim of this work was to explore the applicability of different methods for clustering and classifying trajectories. Methods: The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was a three-year randomized controlled trial with four parallel arms (NCT00672685). The primary outcome was a composite Z-score combining four cognitive tests. The data were analyzed by quadratic mixed effects model. This study was inconclusive. Exploratory analysis is therefore relevant to investigate the use of data-driven methods for trajectory classification. The methods used were unsupervised: k-means for longitudinal data, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised analysis with dichotomous classification according to responder status. Results: Using k-means for longitudinal data, three groups were obtained and one of these groups showed cognitive decline over the three years of follow-up. This method could be applied directly to the primary outcome, the composite Z-score with repeated observations over time. With the two others unsupervised methods, we were unable to process longitudinal data directly. It was therefore necessary to choose an indicator of change in trajectories and to consider the rate of change between two measurements. For the HCA method, Ward's aggregation was performed. The Euclidean distance and rates of change were applied for the graphic semiology method. Lastly, as there were no objective criteria to define responder status, we defined our responders based on clinical criteria. Discussion: In the princeps study, the prevention trial was found to be inconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of the population, which may have masked a treatment effect later identified in a refined subgroup of high Beta Amyloid subjects. So, we have adopted an alternative unsupervised approach to subject stratification based on their trajectories. We could then identify patterns of similar trajectories of cognitive decline and also highlight the potential problem of a large heterogeneity of the profiles, maybe due to the final endpoint considered.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a Transformer-based framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision (AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely intervention and prevention strategies.</p></details> |  |

Prior work shows that adding localized text control signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings, offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles, pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion. Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with prior approaches.

State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy constraints can be systematically computed. However, strict requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical situations. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that leverages graph search to generate long-range trajectories by stitching short trajectory segments together in real time. STITCHER is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through its innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Simulation results show safe trajectories through complex environments can be generated in milliseconds that cover tens of meters.</p></details> |  |

To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories.

However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</p></details> |  |

We propose SteeringTTA, an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.</p></details> |  |

The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |

However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density. Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs' zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output. This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Generative and Agentic AI for Multi-Modality Space-Time Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11499v1)** | 2025-10-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.11499v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex, multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Building upon grasp-matrix formulations and internal force redundancy, we propose a feedback wrench controller that actively regulates the payload's pose while an optimization layer dynamically shapes internal-force oscillations to guarantee persistent carrier motion. Preliminary experimental results on multirotor UAVs validate the model assumptions, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the method successfully prevents carrier stagnation, achieves accurate load tracking, and generates physically feasible trajectories with smooth velocity profiles. The proposed framework not only advances the state of the art but also offers a reliable, versatile solution for future real-world applications requiring load transportation by coordinated non-stopping flying carriers.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments. Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://adap-rpf.github.io/</p></details> |

While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents' summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 GenAI4Health Workshop</p></details> |

This study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers. Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks, transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.</p></details> | 5 figures |

This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  |

Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS), we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies. Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance, achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

In this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque, non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.</p></details> |  |

The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822v2)** | 2025-10-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.20822v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their roles within wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this interconnectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. In this work, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population-crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher levels of burglary, drug possession, robbery, shoplifting, and theft. For example, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population size constant. We demonstrate that models incorporating both population size and commuter inflows explain variation in these offenses better than population-only models. Our findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population-crime relationship.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce DVL-Suite, a comprehensive framework for analyzing long-term urban dynamics through remote sensing imagery. Our suite comprises 14,871 high-resolution (1.0m) multi-temporal images spanning 42 major cities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2023, organized into two components: DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes six urban understanding tasks, from fundamental change detection (pixel-level) to quantitative analyses (regional-level) and comprehensive urban narratives (scene-level), capturing diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster assessment, and environmental challenges. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal their limitations in long-term temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon this dataset, we develop DVLChat, a baseline model capable of both image-level question-answering and pixel-level segmentation, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of city dynamics through language interactions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

The civic tool was developed in partnership with municipal authorities, law enforcement, NGOs, and social services, and reflects their institutional priorities while centering community knowledge. We describe the iterative co-design process, including stakeholder workshops for design, validation, training, and evaluation. The civic tool's impact on stakeholder trust, collaboration, and decision-making was assessed through surveys and open-ended questionnaires. Our findings show that stakeholders valued the inclusive design approach and data-driven collaboration while revealing barriers in communication, data literacy, and operational coordination. Furthermore, political and institutional support was identified as critical to the civic tool's success. This paper contributes to research on community technologies by demonstrating how civic tools can be collaboratively developed to navigate wicked social problems through participatory design.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144,000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. The proposed framework reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32m to 1.24m, achieving a 61.4% improvement, and significantly decreases the intersection centroid offset from 13.22m to 2.01m, corresponding to an 84.8% enhancement. The constructed high-fidelity map is publicly available through https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/perth-cbd-high-resolution-lidar-map-gnss-and-imu-calibration and its visualization can be viewed in the provided in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZUgs1KyMks.

Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards. However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather, Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs, producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a 3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2 requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under 100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales. Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable, real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.</p></details> |  |

It is challenging for governments to tackle these incidents and to rebuild the economic, social and physical infrastructures and facilities with the available resources (mainly budget and time). Governments always define plans and policies according to the law and political strategies that should maximise social benefits. The severity of damage and the vast resources needed to bring life back to normality make such reconstruction a challenge. This article is the extension of our previously published work by conducting comprehensive comparative analysis by integrating additional deep learning models plus random agent which is used as a baseline. Our prior research introduced a decision support system by using the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique for the planning of post-disaster city reconstruction, maximizing the social benefit of the reconstruction process, considering available resources, meeting the needs of the broad community stakeholders (like citizens' social benefits and politicians' priorities) and keeping in consideration city's structural constraints (like dependencies among roads and buildings). The proposed approach, named post disaster REbuilding plAn ProvIdeR (REPAIR) is generic. It can determine a set of alternative plans for local administrators who select the ideal one to implement, and it can be applied to areas of any extension.

Traffic signaling is a key component in effective traffic management for such situations, but the advancements in intelligent traffic signaling have been exclusive to developed countries with structured traffic. The non-lane-based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka City requires a contextual approach.

We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

Based on expert input and a review of the literature, we defined six types of health-related activities: physical, mindfulness, nature appreciation, environmental, social, and cultural. We built a lexicon that links each activity to specific elements and spaces within parks present in OpenStreetMap. Using this data, we scored 23,477 parks across 35 cities worldwide based on their ability to support these activities. We found clear patterns: parks in North America focus more on physical activity, while those in Europe offer more chances to enjoy nature. Parks near city centers support health-promoting activities better than those farther out. Suburban parks in many cities lack the spaces and equipment needed for nature-based, social, and cultural activities. We also found large gaps in park quality between cities. Tokyo and Paris provide more equal access, while Copenhagen and Rio de Janeiro show sharp contrasts. These results can help cities create fairer parks that better support public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In press, Nature Cities</p></details> |

| **[A Modular AIoT Framework for Low-Latency Real-Time Robotic Teleoperation in Smart Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11421v1)** | 2025-10-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.11421v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an AI-driven IoT robotic teleoperation system designed for real-time remote manipulation and intelligent visual monitoring, tailored for smart city applications. The architecture integrates a Flutter-based cross-platform mobile interface with MQTT-based control signaling and WebRTC video streaming via the LiveKit framework. A YOLOv11-nano model is deployed for lightweight object detection, enabling real-time perception with annotated visual overlays delivered to the user interface. Control commands are transmitted via MQTT to an ESP8266-based actuator node, which coordinates multi-axis robotic arm motion through an Arduino Mega2560 controller. The backend infrastructure is hosted on DigitalOcean, ensuring scalable cloud orchestration and stable global communication. Latency evaluations conducted under both local and international VPN scenarios (including Hong Kong, Japan, and Belgium) demonstrate actuator response times as low as 0.2 seconds and total video latency under 1.2 seconds, even across high-latency networks. This low-latency dual-protocol design ensures responsive closed-loop interaction and robust performance in distributed environments. Unlike conventional teleoperation platforms, the proposed system emphasizes modular deployment, real-time AI sensing, and adaptable communication strategies, making it well-suited for smart city scenarios such as remote infrastructure inspection, public equipment servicing, and urban automation. Future enhancements will focus on edge-device deployment, adaptive routing, and integration with city-scale IoT networks to enhance resilience and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve 78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score) classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.</p></details> | 13 pages |

This is because solar energy reduces electrical consumption and provides free energy, while also lowering carbon emissions to create a more sustainable environment. This paper aims to analyze the 2.72kW p rooftop grid-tied PV system performance between 2020 and 2023 in Tarlac City, Philippines. The PV generated yearly is measured by Array Yield (YA), Reference Yield (YR), and Final Yield (YF), which were found to be valued at 3.12, 3.9, and 3.01 kWh/kWp, respectively. The efficiency can decrease due to System Loss (LS) and Capture Loss (LC), which were 0.78 and 0.12 kWh/kWp, respectively. This results in a Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) of 15.52% and a Performance Ratio (PR) of 77.10%. The productivity of PV resulted in an array efficiency was 12.89%, an inverter efficiency was 94.3%, and a system efficiency was 12.16%. PV energy generation was 3,699 kWh, with 2380 kWh fed into the grid annually. The system's annual revenue is $690.59. The payback period is 6 years with a 238.2% Return On Investment (ROI). Carbon emissions are reduced by 0.379 tCO2/kWp/yr.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, Published with International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology (IJETT)</p></details> |
| **[Smart Routing for EV Charge Point Operators in Mega Cities: Case Study of Istanbul](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21369v2)** | 2025-10-02 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.21369v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) has made it even more important to manage the charging infrastructure sustainably. The expansion of charging station networks, especially in large cities, creates serious logistical challenges for charging point operators (CPOs) in planning maintenance and repair activities. Inefficient field personnel management can lead to time loss, high operational costs, and resource waste. This study presents an integrated method to optimize the planning of EV charging network maintenance operations. The proposed approach groups charging stations according to geographical proximity using the K-means clustering algorithm and calculates the shortest routes between clusters using a genetic algorithm. The method was developed in Python and applied to a dataset consisting of 100 EV charging stations in Istanbul. Considering the population density, traffic density, and resource constraints of Istanbul, the route planning approach presented in this study has great potential, especially for such metropolises. According to the different parameter configurations tested, the most efficient scenario provided approximately 35\% distance savings compared to the reference route created according to the sequential data layout. While the reference route provides a simple comparison, the study presents a solution that will enable field operations in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul to be conducted in a more efficient, planned and scalable manner. In future studies, it is planned to integrate real-time factors such as traffic conditions and field technician constraints.</p></details> |  |

The limited computational resources of these devices make them especially susceptible to attacks, while their widespread adoption increases the potential impact of security breaches. This article presents a review of security proposals aimed at protecting IoT devices in Smart City environments. The review was conducted by analyzing recent literature on device-level security, with particular emphasis on lightweight cryptography, physically unclonable functions (PUFs), and blockchain-based solutions. Findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of current approaches, as well as the need for more practical, scalable, and resource-efficient mechanisms to ensure user privacy and data protection in IoT ecosystems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Mobility Behavior Evolution During Extended Emergencies: Returners, Explorers, and the 15-Minute City](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00469v1)** | 2025-10-01 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.00469v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human mobility during emergencies is critical for strengthening urban resilience and guiding emergency management. This study examines transitions between returners, who repeatedly visit a limited set of locations, and explorers, who travel across broader destinations, over a 15-day emergency period in a densely populated metropolitan region using the YJMob100K dataset. High-resolution spatial data reveal intra-urban behavioral dynamics often masked at coarser scales. Beyond static comparisons, we analyze how mobility evolves over time, with varying emergency durations, across weekdays and weekends, and relative to neighborhood boundaries, linking the analysis to the 15-minute city framework. Results show that at least two weeks of data are required to detect meaningful behavioral shifts. During prolonged emergencies, individuals resume visits to non-essential locations more slowly than under normal conditions. Explorers markedly reduce long distance travel, while weekends and holidays consistently exhibit returner-like, short distance patterns. Residents of low Points of Interest (POI) density neighborhoods often travel to POI rich areas, highlighting spatial disparities. Strengthening local accessibility may improve urban resilience during crises. Full reproducibility is supported through the project website: https://github.com/wissamkontar</p></details> |  |

An urban area is considered a ``15-minute city" if every resident can access essential services within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from their home. However, there is an ongoing debate about the effectiveness of this model in reducing car usage and carbon emissions. In this study, we conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis to evaluate the impact of service proximity to homes on CO$_2$ emissions. By examining nearly 400 cities worldwide, we discover that, within the same city, areas with services located closer to residents produce less CO$_2$ emissions per capita from transportation. We establish a clear relationship between the proximity of services and CO$_2$ emissions for each city. Additionally, we quantify the potential reduction in emissions for 30 cities if they optimise the location of their services. This optimisation maintains each city's total number of services while redistributing them to ensure equal accessibility throughout the entire urban area. Our findings indicate that improving the proximity of services can significantly reduce expected urban emissions related to transportation.</p></details> |  |

While recent progress on SLAM has been swift, academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors. We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale. This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at https://www.lamaria.ethz.ch.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[UrbanFeel: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Temporal and Perceptual Understanding of City Scenes through Human Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22228v1)** | 2025-09-26 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.22228v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development. Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as beautiful and safety.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on resource-constrained mobile devices in real-time remains a significant challenge due to two compute-intensive stages: level-of-detail (LoD) search and rasterization. In this paper, we propose Voyager, an effective solution to accelerate city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians within the view frustum remains roughly constant. Leveraging this temporal correlation, we propose a temporal-aware LoD search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the remaining rendering stages. For the remaining rendering process, we accelerate the bottleneck stage, rasterization, via preemptive $\alpha$-filtering. With all optimizations above, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves up to 6.6$\times$ speedup and 85\% energy savings with superior rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

In this context, the main objective of this study is to propose an innovative methodology to automatically evaluate the level of digital transformation (DT) in public sector organizations. The proposed approach combines traditional assessment methods with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The methodology follows a dual approach: on the one hand, surveys are conducted using specialized staff from various public entities; on the other, AI-based models (including neural networks and transformer architectures) are used to estimate the DT level of the organizations automatically. Our approach has been applied to a real-world case study involving local public administrations in the Valencian Community (Spain) and shown effective performance in assessing DT. While the proposed methodology has been validated in a specific local context, its modular structure and dual-source data foundation support its international scalability, acknowledging that administrative, regulatory, and DT maturity factors may condition its broader applicability. The experiments carried out in this work include (i) the creation of a domain-specific corpus derived from the surveys and websites of several organizations, used to train the proposed models; (ii) the use and comparison of diverse AI methods; and (iii) the validation of our approach using real data. The integration of technologies such as the IoT, sensor networks, and AI-based analytics can significantly support resilient, agile urban environments and the transition towards more effective and sustainable Smart City models.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures |

However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Residents of Atlanta and DeKalb County, environmental activists, police and prison abolitionists, and other activists and concerned individuals formed the movement in opposition to the facility, known as the Stop Cop City / Defend the Atlanta Forest movement. Social media and digital maps became common tools for communicating information about the facility and the movement. Here, we examine online maps about the facility and the opposition movement, originating from grassroots organizations, the City of Atlanta, news media outlets, the Atlanta Police Foundation, and individuals. We gather and examine 32 publicly available maps collected through the Google Search API, Twitter (now X), Instagram and reddit. Using a framework of critical cartography, we conduct a content analysis of these maps to identify the mapping technologies and techniques (data, cartographic elements, styles) used by different stakeholders and roles that maps and mapping technologies can play in social movements. We examine the extent to which these maps provide data to confirm or contradict concerns raised by grassroots organizations and local residents about the facility. We find that stakeholders and mapmakers use geospatial tools in different ways and likely have varied access to mapping technologies. We argue that documenting the use of maps to communicate information about a contentious project can help enumerate community positions and perspectives, and we advocate for accessible mapmaking tools. We conclude by discussing the implications of accessibility of mapping technology and posting maps to social media, and share example map images that extend the geographic information systems (GIS) techniques seen in the retrieved maps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PCQ294</p></details> |

In addition to citizen engagement, a smart city enables connected infrastructure, data-driven decision making and smart mobility. For most of these features, network data plays a critical role, particularly from public Wi-Fi infrastructures, where cities can benefit from optimized services such as public transport management and the safety and efficiency of large events. One of the biggest concerns in developing a smart city is using secure and private data. This is particularly relevant in the case of Wi-Fi network data, where sensitive information can be collected. This paper specifically addresses the problem of sharing secure data to enhance the quality of the Wi-Fi network in a city. Despite the high importance of this type of data, related work focuses on improving the safety of mobility patterns, targeting only the protection of MAC addresses. On the opposite side, we provide a practical methodology for safeguarding all attributes in real Wi-Fi network data. This study was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of legal experts, data custodians and technical privacy specialists, resulting in high-quality data. On top of that, we show how to integrate the legal considerations for secure data sharing. Our approach promotes data-driven innovation and privacy awareness in the context of smart city initiatives, which have been tested in a real scenario.</p></details> |  |

Using compressed transformer models and Llama-3-8B for annotation, we classify sentiment across heterogeneous text domains. Our pipeline handles long-form and short-form text, supports consistent annotation, and enables reproducible evaluation. We benchmark five models (DistilRoBERTa, DistilBERT, MiniLM, ELECTRA, TinyBERT) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1-score, AUC, and training time. DistilRoBERTa achieved the highest F1 (0.8292), TinyBERT the best efficiency, and MiniLM the best cross-platform consistency. Results show News data yields inflated performance due to class imbalance, Reddit suffers from summarization loss, and Twitter offers moderate challenge. Compressed models perform competitively, challenging assumptions that larger models are necessary. We identify platform-specific trade-offs and propose directions for scalable, real-world sentiment classification in urban planning discourse.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's preprint version of a paper accepted for presentation at the 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2025), December 3-5, 2025, Florida, USA.

We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring equal selection probability for constituents ex ante. We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.</p></details> |  |

However, the intensive manual effort required to prepare input 3D city models has hindered its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we present VoxCity, an open-source Python package that provides a one-stop solution for grid-based 3D city model generation and urban environment simulation for cities worldwide. VoxCity's `generator' subpackage automatically downloads building heights, tree canopy heights, land cover, and terrain elevation within a specified target area, and voxelizes buildings, trees, land cover, and terrain to generate an integrated voxel city model. The `simulator' subpackage enables users to conduct environmental simulations, including solar radiation and view index analyses. Users can export the generated models using several file formats compatible with external software, such as ENVI-met (INX), Blender, and Rhino (OBJ). We generated 3D city models for eight global cities, and demonstrated the calculation of solar irradiance, sky view index, and green view index. We also showcased microclimate simulation and 3D rendering visualization through ENVI-met and Rhino, respectively, through the file export function. Additionally, we reviewed openly available geospatial data to create guidelines to help users choose appropriate data sources depending on their target areas and purposes. VoxCity can significantly reduce the effort and time required for 3D city model preparation and promote the utilization of urban environment simulations. This contributes to more informed urban and architectural design that considers environmental impacts, and in turn, fosters sustainable and livable cities. VoxCity is released openly at https://github.com/kunifujiwara/VoxCity.</p></details> |  |

Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore, existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components: (1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively, surpassing existing methods by significant margins.</p></details> |  |

Conventional fixes enlarge the training set or replay past data, but these strategies incur high data collection costs, sample inefficiently and fail to balance long- and short-term experience, leaving them short of human-like continual learning. Here we introduce Dual-LS, a task-free, online continual learning paradigm for DNN-based motion forecasting that is inspired by the complementary learning system of the human brain. Dual-LS pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval while dynamically coordinating long-term and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on naturalistic data spanning three countries, over 772,000 vehicles and cumulative testing mileage of 11,187 km show that Dual-LS mitigates catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31\% and reduces computational resource demand by up to 94.02\%, markedly boosting predictive stability in vehicle motion forecasting without inflating data requirements. Meanwhile, it endows DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting with computation efficient and human-like continual learning adaptability fit for smart cities.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations. Leveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of downstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban simulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 4D cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals. The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle. To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali. Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling effective noise pollution management and urban planning.</p></details> |  |

While this information offers unprecedented opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale, latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge, LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources. Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation, this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable smart infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

It is common that large software systems offer a web interface for user interaction. Usually, available web interfaces are not regarded in software visualization tools. This paper introduces additions to the web-based live tracing software visualization tool ExplorViz: We add an embedded web view for instrumented applications in the 3D visualization to ease interaction with the given applications and enable the exploration of the thereby displayed HTML content. Namely, the Document Object Model (DOM) is visualized via a three-dimensional representation of the HTML structure in same-origin contexts. Our visualization approach is evaluated in a preliminary user study. The study results give insights into the potential use cases, benefits, and shortcomings of our implemented approach. Based on our study results, we propose directions for further research to support the visual exploration of web interfaces and explore use cases for the combined visualization of software cities and HTML structure.

| **[Semantic Zoom and Mini-Maps for Software Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00003v1)** | 2025-08-26 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.00003v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software visualization tools can facilitate program comprehension by providing visual metaphors, or abstractions that reduce the amount of textual data that needs to be processed mentally. One way they do this is by enabling developers to build an internal representation of the visualized software and its architecture. However, as the amount of displayed data in the visualization increases, the visualization itself can become more difficult to comprehend. The ability to display small and large amounts of data in visualizations is called visual scalability. In this paper, we present two approaches to address the challenge of visual scalability in 3D software cities. First, we present an approach to semantic zoom, in which the graphical representation of the software landscape changes based on the virtual camera's distance from visual objects. Second, we augment the visualization with a miniature two-dimensional top-view projection called mini-map. We demonstrate our approach using an open-source implementation in our software visualization tool ExplorViz. ExplorViz is web-based and uses the 3D city metaphor, focusing on live trace visualization. We evaluated our approaches in two separate user studies. The results indicate that semantic zoom and the mini-map are both useful additions. User feedback indicates that semantic zoom and mini-maps are especially useful for large software landscapes and collaborative software exploration. The studies indicate a good usability of our implemented approaches. However, some shortcomings in our implementations have also been discovered, to be addressed in future work.

Given this limitation, meeting the low-latency service requirement of 6G networks becomes even more challenging. However, existing 6G IoT management strategies lack real-time operation and mostly rely on discrete actions, which are insufficient to optimise energy consumption. To address these, in this study, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-guided energy management framework to jointly handle the low latency and energy efficiency challenges in 6G IoT networks. In this framework, we provide the twin models through a distributed overlay network and handle the dynamic updates between the data layer and the upper layers of the DT over the Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) protocol. We also design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine with a novel formulated reward function to provide optimal data update times for each of the IoT devices. The RL engine receives a diverse set of environment states from the What-if engine and runs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to output continuous actions to the IoT devices. Based on our simulation results, we observe that the proposed framework achieves a 37% improvement in 95th percentile latency and a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to the existing literature.</p></details> |  |

However, as DTs take active roles in control loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic and adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing authentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require centralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable physical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and distributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a lightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to establish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs without relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind significantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and 4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines, while maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower. These findings highlight its suitability for future smart city deployments requiring efficient, resilient, and trustworthy DT authentication.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, Accepted by IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.</p></details> |  |

It then evolved rapidly by including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different application domains and research communities, acknowledging the interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the Model-Driven Engineering community.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the quality and biases of AI-generated Open Building Datasets (OBDs) generated by Google and Microsoft against OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, across diverse global cities including Accra, Nairobi, Caracas, Berlin, and Houston. The Intersection over Union (IoU), overlap analysis and a positional accuracy algorithm are used to analyse the similarity and alignment of the datasets. The paper also analyses the size distribution of the building polygon area, and completeness using predefined but regular spatial units. The results indicate significant variance in data quality, with Houston and Berlin demonstrating high alignment and completeness, reflecting their structured urban environments. There are gaps in the datasets analysed, and cities like Accra and Caracas may be under-represented. This could highlight difficulties in capturing complex or informal regions. The study also notes different building size distributions, which may be indicative of the global socio-economic divide. These findings may emphasise the need to consider the quality of global building datasets to avoid misrepresentation, which is an important element of planning and resource distribution.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 pages |

As cities increasingly deploy artificial intelligence (AI) systems, concerns around equity, accountability, and normative legitimacy are growing. This paper introduces the Urban Reasonableness Layer (URL), a conceptual framework that adapts the legal "reasonable person" standard for supervisory oversight in municipal AI systems, including potential future implementations of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Drawing on historical analogies, scenario mapping, and participatory norm-setting, we explore how legal and community-derived standards can inform AI decision-making in urban contexts. Rather than prescribing a fixed solution, the URL is proposed as an exploratory architecture for negotiating contested values, aligning automation with democratic processes, and interrogating the limits of technical alignment. Our key contributions include: (1) articulating the conceptual and operational architecture of the URL; (2) specifying participatory mechanisms for dynamic normative threshold-setting; (3) presenting a comparative scenario analysis of governance trajectories; and (4) outlining evaluation metrics and limitations. This work contributes to ongoing debates on urban AI governance by foregrounding pluralism, contestability, and the inherently political nature of socio-technical systems.</p></details> |  |

These drones must intercept/eliminate the threat, thus reducing potential damage from the attack. We model this as a Sequential Stackelberg Security Game, where the defender first commits to a mixed sequential defense strategy, and the attacker then best responds. We develop an efficient algorithm called S2D2, which outputs a defense strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of S2D2 in extensive experiments on data from 80 real cities, improving the performance of the defender in comparison to greedy heuristics based on prior works. We prove that under some reasonable assumptions about the city structure, S2D2 outputs an approximate Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) with a convenient structure.</p></details> | 59 pages, 10 figures |

Using specialized or foundational models, GenAI's natural language abilities such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) can power tailored applications and unified interfaces, dramatically lowering barriers for users interacting with complex smart city systems. In this paper, we focus on GenAI applications based on conversational interfaces within the context of three critical user archetypes in a Smart City - Citizens, Operators and Planners. We identify and review GenAI models and techniques that have been proposed or deployed for various urban subsystems in the contexts of these user archetypes. We also consider how GenAI can be built on the existing data foundation of official city records, IoT data streams and Urban Digital Twins.

However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.</p></details> |  |

Initially envisioned in the 1950s, the City Tower project is a skyscraper structure based on a tetrahedral and octahedral space frame called Octet-Truss. The aim of this study is to analyze the geometry of the City Tower structure and how it can be used to develop modular and adaptable architectural forms. The study is based on an analytical shape grammar that is used to recreate the original structure, and later to generate new structural configurations based on the City Tower's morphology.

The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, the inherent randomness, non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniMove/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

We hypothesize that street view imagery -- an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer relationships between specific types of social interactions and built environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant cities.</p></details> |  |

This paper leverages network science to conduct a multi-modal analysis of San Diego's transportation system. We construct a multi-layer graph using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), representing driving, walking, and public transit layers. By integrating thousands of Points of Interest (POIs), we analyze network accessibility, structure, and resilience through centrality measures, community detection, and a proposed metric for walkability. Our analysis reveals a system defined by a stark core-periphery divide. We find that while the urban core is well-integrated, 30.3% of POIs are isolated from public transit within a walkable distance, indicating significant equity gaps in suburban and rural access. Centrality analysis highlights the driving network's over-reliance on critical freeways as bottlenecks, suggesting low network resilience, while confirming that San Diego is not a broadly walkable city. Furthermore, community detection demonstrates that transportation mode dictates the scale of mobility, producing compact, local clusters for walking and broad, regional clusters for driving. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing urban mobility systems, offering quantitative insights that can inform targeted interventions to improve transportation equity and infrastructure resilience in San Diego.</p></details> |  |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.</p></details> |  |

Conventional smart city mapping techniques, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth. However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei. We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields 40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and (iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work partly supported by the RA Science Committee grant No. 22rl-052 (DISTAL) and the EU under Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan of NextGenerationEU on "Telecommunications of the Future" (PE00000001 - program "RESTART")</p></details> |

While traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable, fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities. This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor. Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\% improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score of predicting immobility compared to the baselines.

We are not trying to reproduce existing cities, but to generate artificial cities that are convincing and plausible by capturing developmental behavior. In addition, our results are meant to build upon themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments, whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions. With the aid of agent based simulation we are generating a system of agents and behaviors that interact with one another through their effects upon a simulated environment. Our philosophy is that as each agent follows a simple behavioral rule set, a more complex behavior will tend to emerge out of the interactions between the agents and their differing rule sets. By confining our model to a set of simple rules for each class of agents, we hope to make our model extendible not only in regard to the types of structures that are produced, but also in describing the social and cultural influences prevalent in all cities</p></details> |  |

Yet existing methods face key limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning, UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.</p></details> |  |

An Agent-Based Simulation of Human Mobility in a Futuristic Smart City](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143v1)** | 2025-07-20 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.15143v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to 8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70 percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.</p></details> |  |

Applications to urban science are numerous, from facilitating comparisons between delineated districts and administrative divisions to informing policymakers of the shifting economic and labor landscapes. In this study, we propose using commute networks sourced from the census for the purpose of urban delineation, by modeling them with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. We derive low-dimensional representations of granular urban areas (nodes) using GNNs. Subsequently, nodes' embeddings are clustered to identify spatially cohesive communities in urban areas. Our experiments across the U.S. demonstrate the effectiveness of network embeddings in capturing significant socioeconomic disparities between communities in various cities, particularly in factors such as median household income. The role of census mobility data in regional delineation is also noted, and we establish the utility of GNNs in urban community detection, as a powerful alternative to existing methods in this domain. The results offer insights into the wider effects of commute networks and their use in building meaningful representations of urban regions.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, reusing existing infrastructures to develop alternative communication strategies after disasters is essential to minimise the impact of these events on the population's ability to communicate and promptly receive alerts from authorities. In this context, the emergence of smart cities, characterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents significant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient architecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network, whose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication system to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video) between citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote monitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled flooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and tested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor environments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of obstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average latency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and 726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow network, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all functionalities associated with the HaLert architecture. The tests conducted on the LoRa network revealed a high average message success rate of 94.96%.</p></details> |  |

Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP). However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data (TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions. Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

This study compares iNETs across platforms (Google Places and Foursquare) and spatial granularities, showing that coarser levels reveal more consistent cross-platform patterns, while finer granularities expose subtle, platform-specific behaviors. Our analysis finds that, in general, user interest is primarily shaped by geographic proximity and venue similarity, while socioeconomic and political contexts play a lesser role. Building on these insights, we develop a multi-level, explainable recommendation system that predicts high-interest urban regions for different user types. The model adapts to behavior profiles -- such as explorers, who are driven by proximity, and returners, who prefer familiar venues -- and provides natural-language explanations using explainable AI (XAI) techniques. To support our approach, we introduce h3-cities, a tool for multi-scale spatial analysis, and release a public demo for interactively exploring personalized urban recommendations.

However, most existing methods rely heavily on neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image, achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Advanced time series decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban hospitality forecasting and provide a comparative framework for data-driven decision-making.

Previous wireframe-alignment-based method LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models. However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes. Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2 improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[GeoProg3D: Compositional Visual Reasoning for City-Scale 3D Language Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23352v1)** | 2025-06-29 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.23352v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with 3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

| **[SceneDiffuser++: City-Scale Traffic Simulation via a Generative World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21976v1)** | 2025-06-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.21976v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to support trip-level simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
