| **[StefaLand: An Efficient Geoscience Foundation Model That Improves Dynamic Land-Surface Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17942v2)** | 2025-09-28 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.17942v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy. Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[RAG for Geoscience: What We Expect, Gaps and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11246v1)** | 2025-08-15 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.11246v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by combining retrieval with generation. However, its current workflow remains largely text-centric, limiting its applicability in geoscience. Many geoscientific tasks are inherently evidence-hungry. Typical examples involve imputing missing observations using analog scenes, retrieving equations and parameters to calibrate models, geolocating field photos based on visual cues, or surfacing historical case studies to support policy analyses. A simple ``retrieve-then-generate'' pipeline is insufficient for these needs. We envision Geo-RAG, a next-generation paradigm that reimagines RAG as a modular retrieve $\rightarrow$ reason $\rightarrow$ generate $\rightarrow$ verify loop. Geo-RAG supports four core capabilities: (i) retrieval of multi-modal Earth data; (ii) reasoning under physical and domain constraints; (iii) generation of science-grade artifacts; and (iv) verification of generated hypotheses against numerical models, ground measurements, and expert assessments. This shift opens new opportunities for more trustworthy and transparent geoscience workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoRSMLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Vision-Language Tasks in Geoscience and Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12490v1)** | 2025-03-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12490v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  |

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accpe...</summary><p>accpeted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> |

In this work, we discuss a series of developments in the field of prototype-based XAI that show potential for scientific learning tasks, with a focus on the geosciences. We organize the prototype-based XAI literature into three themes: the development and visualization of prototypes, types of prototypes, and the use of prototypes in various learning tasks. We discuss how the authors use prototype-based methods, their novel contributions, and any limitations or challenges that may arise when adapting these methods for geoscientific learning tasks. We highlight differences between geoscientific data sets and the standard benchmarks used to develop XAI methods, and discuss how specific geoscientific applications may benefit from using or modifying existing prototype-based XAI techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI for Science Workshop-Oral (Attention Track), Proceedings of 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Geoscience Artificial Intelligence (XGeoS-AI): Application to Demystify Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04940v2)** | 2024-05-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.04940v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth science enters the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) not only offers great potential for solving geoscience problems, but also plays a critical role in accelerating the understanding of the complex, interactive, and multiscale processes of Earth's behavior. As geoscience AI models are progressively utilized for significant predictions in crucial situations, geoscience researchers are increasingly demanding their interpretability and versatility. This study proposes an interpretable geoscience artificial intelligence (XGeoS-AI) framework to unravel the mystery of image recognition in the Earth sciences, and its effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated by taking computed tomography (CT) image recognition as an example. Inspired by the mechanism of human vision, the proposed XGeoS-AI framework generates a threshold value from a local region within the whole image to complete the recognition. Different kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can be adopted as the AI engines of the proposed XGeoS-AI framework to efficiently complete geoscience image recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness, versatility, and heuristics of the proposed framework have great potential in solving geoscience image recognition problems. Interpretable AI should receive more and more attention in the field of the Earth sciences, which is the key to promoting more rational and wider applications of AI in the field of Earth sciences. In addition, the proposed interpretable framework may be the forerunner of technological innovation in the Earth sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some erros in the results, and a newer revision is still preparing</p></details> |
| **[GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00434v2)** | 2024-04-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2401.00434v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success for their general knowledge and ability to solve a wide spectrum of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically, GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens, preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica, including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training, SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel approach for estimating functions in the multivariate setting based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines with an application to a chemical system used in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00686v3)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2306.00686v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we will outline a novel data-driven method for estimating functions in a multivariate nonparametric regression model based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines. The underlying idea of our approach for selecting knots is to apply the generalized lasso, since the knots of the B-spline basis can be seen as changes in the derivatives of the function to be estimated. This method was then extended to functions depending on several variables by processing each dimension independently, thus reducing the problem to a univariate setting. The regularization parameters were chosen by means of a criterion based on EBIC. The nonparametric estimator was obtained using a multivariate B-spline regression with the corresponding selected knots. Our procedure was validated through numerical experiments by varying the number of observations and the level of noise to investigate its robustness. The influence of observation sampling was also assessed and our method was applied to a chemical system commonly used in geoscience. For each different framework considered in this paper, our approach performed better than state-of-the-art methods. Our completely data-driven method is implemented in the glober R package which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</p></details> | 29 pages, 27 figures |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Generative AI and Large Language Models: Foundations, Trends, and Future Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03349v1)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.03349v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) represents an emerging field that promises the creation of synthetic data and outputs in different modalities. GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models that have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks (GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience community in several applications, including (but not limited to) data generation/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze removal, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain such as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and trustworthiness. Beyond that, GAI models show promises to the geoscience community, especially with the support to climate change, urban science, atmospheric science, marine science, and planetary science through their extraordinary ability to data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable modeling to unify machine learning and physical models and advance Geosciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04027v2)** | 2023-12-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2301.04027v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-Based Modeling (PBM) and Machine Learning (ML) are often perceived as distinct paradigms in the geosciences. Here we present differentiable geoscientific modeling as a powerful pathway toward dissolving the perceived barrier between them and ushering in a paradigm shift. For decades, PBM offered benefits in interpretability and physical consistency but struggled to efficiently leverage large datasets. ML methods, especially deep networks, presented strong predictive skills yet lacked the ability to answer specific scientific questions. While various methods have been proposed for ML-physics integration, an important underlying theme -- differentiable modeling -- is not sufficiently recognized. Here we outline the concepts, applicability, and significance of differentiable geoscientific modeling (DG). "Differentiable" refers to accurately and efficiently calculating gradients with respect to model variables, critically enabling the learning of high-dimensional unknown relationships. DG refers to a range of methods connecting varying amounts of prior knowledge to neural networks and training them together, capturing a different scope than physics-guided machine learning and emphasizing first principles. Preliminary evidence suggests DG offers better interpretability and causality than ML, improved generalizability and extrapolation capability, and strong potential for knowledge discovery, while approaching the performance of purely data-driven ML. DG models require less training data while scaling favorably in performance and efficiency with increasing amounts of data. With DG, geoscientists may be better able to frame and investigate questions, test hypotheses, and discover unrecognized linkages.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model. Moreover, we share a protocol that can efficiently gather domain-specific data and construct domain-supervised data, even in situations where manpower is scarce. Meanwhile, we equip K2 with the abilities of using tools to be a naive geoscience aide. Experiments conducted on the GeoBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and datasets on geoscience knowledge understanding and utilization.We open-source all the training data and K2 model checkpoints at https://github.com/davendw49/k2.</p></details> |  |

AI algorithms, especially deep learning-based ones, have been developed and applied widely to RS data analysis. The successful application of AI covers almost all aspects of Earth observation (EO) missions, from low-level vision tasks like super-resolution, denoising and inpainting, to high-level vision tasks like scene classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. While AI techniques enable researchers to observe and understand the Earth more accurately, the vulnerability and uncertainty of AI models deserve further attention, considering that many geoscience and RS tasks are highly safety-critical. This paper reviews the current development of AI security in the geoscience and RS field, covering the following five important aspects: adversarial attack, backdoor attack, federated learning, uncertainty and explainability. Moreover, the potential opportunities and trends are discussed to provide insights for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to provide a systematic review of AI security-related research in the geoscience and RS community. Available code and datasets are also listed in the paper to move this vibrant field of research forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coarse-to-fine Task-driven Inpainting for Geoscience Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11059v3)** | 2022-12-06 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2211.11059v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The processing and recognition of geoscience images have wide applications. Most of existing researches focus on understanding the high-quality geoscience images by assuming that all the images are clear. However, in many real-world cases, the geoscience images might contain occlusions during the image acquisition. This problem actually implies the image inpainting problem in computer vision and multimedia. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing image inpainting algorithms learn to repair the occluded regions for a better visualization quality, they are excellent for natural images but not good enough for geoscience images by ignoring the geoscience related tasks. This paper aims to repair the occluded regions for a better geoscience task performance with the advanced visualization quality simultaneously, without changing the current deployed deep learning based geoscience models. Because of the complex context of geoscience images, we propose a coarse-to-fine encoder-decoder network with coarse-to-fine adversarial context discriminators to reconstruct the occluded image regions. Due to the limited data of geoscience images, we use a MaskMix based data augmentation method to exploit more information from limited geoscience image data. The experimental results on three public geoscience datasets for remote sensing scene recognition, cross-view geolocation and semantic segmentation tasks respectively show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.</p></details> |  |

However, the predominant reliance on visual encoding of data continues to create accessibility barriers for people who are blind/vision impaired resulting in their under representation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This research study seeks to understand the experiences of professionals who are blind/vision impaired in one such STEM discipline (geosciences) in accessing data visualizations. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven professionals were conducted to examine the accessibility barriers and areas for improvement to inform accessibility research pertaining to data visualizations through a socio-technical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of visualizations in influencing their career path, lack of data exploration tools for research, barriers in accessing works of peers and mismatched pace of visualization and accessibility research. The article also includes recommendations from the participants to address some of these accessibility barriers.</p></details> |  |

Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated preprint version of the manuscript.

Quantifying complexity and non-stationarity of these data is a challenging task, and advanced complexity-based exploratory tool are required for understanding and visualizing such data.

The state-of-the-art studies related to the Fisher-Shannon measures are collected, and new analytical formulas for positive unimodal skewed distributions are proposed. Case studies on both synthetic and real data illustrate the usefulness of the Fisher-Shannon method, which can find application in different domains including time series discrimination and generation of times series features for clustering, modeling and forecasting. The paper is accompanied with Python and R libraries for the non-parametric estimation of the proposed measures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference, thus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions, and 2) the estimation of {\em statistical independence} between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the {\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.</p></details> |  |

A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope. In general, I aim to provide context for the recent enthusiasm surrounding deep learning with respect to research, hardware, and software developments that enable successful application of shallow and deep machine learning in all disciplines of Earth science.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 17 figures, book chapter</p></details> |

As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The second version of this manuscript is currently under review at the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)</p></details> |

Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media, memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming "enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression techniques.</p></details> |  |

They have been applied in numerous science areas, but their application to the geosciences has been limited due to their inefficiency in high-dimensional systems in standard settings. However, huge progress has been made, and this limitation is disappearing fast due to recent developments in proposal densities, the use of ideas from (optimal) transportation, the use of localisation and intelligent adaptive resampling strategies. Furthermore, powerful hybrids between particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods have been developed. We present a state of the art discussion of present efforts of developing particle filters for highly nonlinear geoscience state-estimation problems with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic applications, including many new ideas, derivations, and unifications, highlighting hidden connections, and generating a valuable tool and guide for the community. Initial experiments show that particle filters can be competitive with present-day methods for numerical weather prediction suggesting that they will become mainstream soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Review paper, 36 pages, 9 figures, Resubmitted to Q.J.Royal Meteorol.

A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is easy to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the corresponding exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated log-normal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a truncated power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated log-normals, although wildfires also may show power-law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to the analyzed data sets, but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in the future.</p></details> |  |

This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. Data assimilation is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of data assimilation, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of data assimilation being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of data assimilation and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 10 figures, Invited review</p></details> |

As geosciences enters the era of big data, machine learning (ML) -- that has been widely successful in commercial domains -- offers immense potential to contribute to problems in geosciences. However, problems in geosciences have several unique challenges that are seldom found in traditional applications, requiring novel problem formulations and methodologies in machine learning. This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it challenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions for methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing some of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable across all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</p></details> |

Expressions for the outage probability (OP), based on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), are derived for slow FAMA. Interestingly, we provide mathematical relationships that allow the expressions of fast FAMA to be obtained from slow FAMA. Multiplexing gains for an opportunistic FAMA (OFAMA) network are presented for both slow and fast FAMA scenarios. Our analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations, under various channel and system parameters. All expressions derived in this work are original.</p></details> |  |

Recent evidence, however, suggests that even in low mortality countries improvements may be slowing and regional inequalities widening. This study contributes new empirical evidence to the debate by analysing mortality data by single year of age for males and females across 107 provinces in Italy from 2002 to 2019. We extend the widely used Lee Carter model to include spatially varying age specific effects, and further specify it to capture space age time interactions. The model is estimated in a Bayesian framework using the inlabru package, which builds on INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation) for non linear models and facilitates the use of smoothing priors. This approach borrows strength across provinces and years, mitigating random fluctuations in small area death counts. Results demonstrate the value of such a granular approach, highlighting the existence of an uneven geography of mortality despite overall national improvements. Mortality disadvantage is concentrated in parts of the Centre South and North West, while the Centre North and North East fare relatively better. These geographical differences have widened since 2010, with clear age and gender specific patterns, being more pronounced at younger adult ages for men and at older adult ages for women. Future work may involve refining the analysis to mortality by cause of death or socioeconomic status, informing more targeted public health policies to address mortality disparities across Italy's provinces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning under Vision: Understanding Visual-Spatial Cognition in Vision-Language Models for CAPTCHA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06067v1)** | 2025-10-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.06067v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning, we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.</p></details> | 14pages, 11figures |

However, existing methods often lack the fine-grained control needed to generate viewpoint-specific content from larger, immersive 360-degree environments. This limitation restricts the creation of audio-visual experiences that are aware of off-camera events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a framework for controllable audio-visual generation, addressing this unexplored gap. Specifically, we propose a diffusion model by introducing a set of powerful conditioning signals derived from the full 360-degree space: a panoramic saliency map to identify regions of interest, a bounding-box-aware signed distance map to define the target viewpoint, and a descriptive caption of the entire scene. By integrating these controls, our model generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios that are coherently influenced by the broader, unseen environmental context, introducing a strong controllability that is essential for realistic and immersive audio-visual generation. We show audiovisual examples proving the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  |

To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle.

To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover, StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models, reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed, given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</p></details> |  |

While audio language models excel in sound recognition, single-channel input fundamentally limits spatial understanding. This work presents Sci-Phi, a spatial audio large language model with dual spatial and spectral encoders that estimates a complete parameter set for all sound sources and the surrounding environment. Learning from over 4,000 hours of synthetic first-order Ambisonics recordings including metadata, Sci-Phi enumerates and describes up to four directional sound sources in one pass, alongside non-directional background sounds and room characteristics. We evaluate the model with a permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content, location, timing, loudness, and reverberation, and analyze its robustness across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and challenging mixtures of acoustically, spatially, or temporally similar sources. Notably, Sci-Phi generalizes to real room impulse responses with only minor performance degradation. Overall, this work establishes the first audio LLM capable of full spatial-scene description, with strong potential for real-world deployment.

Drawing on Construal Level Theory, we conducted a three-week field study with 47 caregivers using a chatbot that delivered daily reflective writing prompts and captured temporal, spatial, and social contexts. We collected 958 writing entries, resulting in 5,412 coded segments. Our Analysis revealed two reflective modes. Under proximal conditions, participants produced detailed, emotion-rich, and care recipient-focused narratives that supported emotional release. Under distal conditions, they generated calmer, self-focused, and analytic accounts that enabled objective reflection and cognitive reappraisal. Participants described trade-offs: proximity preserved vivid detail but limited objectivity, while distance enabled analysis but risked memory loss. This work contributes empirical evidence of how psychological distances shape reflective writing and proposes design implications for distance-aware Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for family caregivers' mental health support.</p></details> |  |

To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple spatial capabilities, even for handling simple and normal tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

The low rank component coefficients are endowed with a flexible graphical Gaussian Markov random field model. The utilization of a low rank and compactly-supported covariance structure combines the full-scale approximation and the basis graphical lasso; we term this new approach the full-scale basis graphical lasso (FSBGL). Estimation employs a graphical lasso-penalized likelihood, which is optimized using a difference-of-convex scheme. We illustrate the proposed approach on synthetic fields as well as with a challenging high-resolution simulation dataset of the thermosphere. In a comparison against state-of-the-art spatial models, the FSBGL performs better at capturing salient features of the thermospheric temperature fields, even with limited available training data.</p></details> |  |

We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE) of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC) of 0.7794.

The benchmark covers core spatial tasks, including distance measurement, visibility, path finding, and object placement within constrained spaces. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs reveal that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to respect physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, though they remain mostly robust to small spatial perturbations. FloorplanQA uncovers a blind spot in today's LLMs: inconsistent reasoning about indoor layouts.

Numerous feature fusion techniques address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity. In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing Mamba-based approaches often overlook the directional modeling heterogeneity across different land-cover types, leading to limited classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMoE, a novel spectral-spatial Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, which represents the first MoE-based approach in the HSI classification domain. Specifically, we design a Mixture of Mamba Expert Block (MoMEB) that performs adaptive spectral-spatial feature modeling via a sparse expert activation mechanism. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-guided corrective learning (UGCL) strategy that encourages the model to focus on complex regions prone to prediction ambiguity. This strategy dynamically samples supervision signals from regions with high predictive uncertainty, guiding the model to adaptively refine feature representations and thereby enhancing its focus on challenging areas.

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Predicting expression directly from widely available Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses. We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling.

Its approximation is often crucial for computational feasibility in simulation, inference, and uncertainty quantification. The Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion provides a theoretically optimal basis for representing a Gaussian random field as a sum of deterministic orthonormal functions weighted by uncorrelated random variables. While this is a well-established method for dimension reduction and approximation of (spatial) stochastic process, its practical application depends on the explicit or implicit definition of the covariance structure. In this work we propose a novel approach to approximating Gaussian random field by explicitly constructing its covariance function from a regularized thin plate splines kernel. In a numerical analysis, the regularized thin plate splines kernel model, under a Bayesian approach, correctly capture the spatial correlation in the different proposed scenarios. Furthermore, the penalty term effectively shrinks most basis function coefficients toward zero, the eigenvalues decay and cumulative variance show that the proposed model efficiently reduces data dimensionality by capturing most of the variance with only a few basis functions. More importantly, from the numerical analysis we can suggest its strong potential for use beyond the Matern correlation function. In a real application, it behaves well when modeling the NO2 concentrations measured at monitoring stations throughout Germany. It has good predictive performance when assessed using the posterior medians and also demonstrate best predictive performance compared with another popular method to approximate a Gaussian random field.</p></details> |  |

However, such context-dependent querying becomes incapable as the environment grows much longer, motivating the need for incremental map construction that builds a complete topological graph from stepwise observations. We propose a framework for LLM-driven construction and map repair, designed to detect, localize, and correct structural inconsistencies in incrementally constructed navigation graphs. Central to our method is the Version Control, which records the full history of graph edits and their source observations, enabling fine-grained rollback, conflict tracing, and repair evaluation. We further introduce an Edge Impact Score to prioritize minimal-cost repairs based on structural reachability, path usage, and conflict propagation. To properly evaluate our approach, we create a refined version of the MANGO benchmark dataset by systematically removing non-topological actions and inherent structural conflicts, providing a cleaner testbed for LLM-driven construction and map repair. Our approach significantly improves map correctness and robustness, especially in scenarios with entangled or chained inconsistencies. Our results highlight the importance of introspective, history-aware repair mechanisms for maintaining coherent spatial memory in LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

While previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation offer a promising solution by leveraging self-refinement per frame, they suffer from two major limitations: 1) unstable frame-wise predictions caused by temporal inconsistency, and 2) consistently incorrect predictions that violate the assumption of reliable modality guidance. To address these limitations, this work introduces a comprehensive two-fold framework. Firstly, building upon our previous work ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), we propose Latte++ that better suppresses the unstable frame-wise predictions with more informative geometric correspondences. Instead of utilizing a universal sliding window, Latte++ employs multi-window aggregation to capture more reliable correspondences to better evaluate the local prediction consistency of different semantic categories. Secondly, to tackle the consistently incorrect predictions, we propose Interactive Test-Time Adaptation (ITTA), a flexible add-on to empower effortless human feedback with existing MM-TTA methods. ITTA introduces a novel human-in-the-loop approach that efficiently integrates minimal human feedback through interactive segmentation, requiring only simple point clicks and bounding box annotations. Instead of using independent interactive networks, ITTA employs a lightweight promptable branch with a momentum gradient module to capture and reuse knowledge from scarce human feedback during online inference. Extensive experiments across five MM-TTA benchmarks demonstrate that ITTA achieves consistent and notable improvements with robust performance gains for target classes of interest in challenging imbalanced scenarios, while Latte++ provides complementary benefits for temporal stability.</p></details> |  |

However, a serious hurdle in fitting point process models is the presence of duplicated points, wherein multiple observations share identical spatial coordinates. This often occurs because of decisions made in the geo-coding process, such as assigning representative locations (e.g., aggregate-level centroids) to observations when data producers lack exact location information. Because spatial point process models like the Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) assume unique locations, researchers often employ ad hoc solutions (e.g., removing duplicates or jittering) to address duplicated data before analysis. As an alternative, this study proposes a Modified Minimum Contrast (MMC) method that adapts the inference procedure to account for the effect of duplicates in estimation, without needing to alter the data. The proposed MMC method is applied to LGCP models, focusing on the inference of second-order intensity parameters, which govern the clustering structure of point patterns. Under a variety of simulated conditions, our results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed MMC method compared to existing ad hoc solutions. We then apply the MMC methods to a real-data application of conflict events in Afghanistan (2008-2009).</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50 achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18% along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve, respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we present Spatial CAPTCHA, a novel human-verification framework that leverages fundamental differences in spatial reasoning between humans and MLLMs. Unlike existing CAPTCHAs which rely on low-level perception tasks that are vulnerable to modern AI, Spatial CAPTCHA generates dynamic questions requiring geometric reasoning, perspective-taking, occlusion handling, and mental rotation. These skills are intuitive for humans but difficult for state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI systems. The system employs a procedural generation pipeline with constraint-based difficulty control, automated correctness verification, and human-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, robustness, and adaptability. Evaluation on a corresponding benchmark, Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench, demonstrates that humans vastly outperform 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the best model achieving only 31.0% Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we compare Spatial CAPTCHA with Google reCAPTCHA, which confirms its effectiveness as both a security mechanism and a diagnostic tool for spatial reasoning in AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

MetaSpatial addresses two core challenges: (i) the lack of internalized 3D spatial reasoning in VLMs, which limits their ability to generate realistic layouts, and (ii) the inefficiency of traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for layout generation tasks, as perfect ground truth annotations are unavailable. Our key innovation is a multi-turn RL-based optimization mechanism that integrates physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations, ensuring generated 3D layouts are coherent, physically plausible, and aesthetically consistent. Methodologically, MetaSpatial introduces an adaptive, iterative reasoning process, where the VLM refines spatial arrangements over multiple turns by analyzing rendered outputs, improving scene coherence progressively. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MetaSpatial significantly enhances the spatial consistency and formatting stability of various scale models. Post-training, object placements are more realistic, aligned, and functionally coherent, validating the effectiveness of RL for 3D spatial reasoning in metaverse, AR/VR, digital twins, and game development applications. Our code, data, and training pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/PzySeere/MetaSpatial.</p></details> | Working Paper |

However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2025</p></details> |

Analyzing PFAS in groundwater is challenging due to left-censoring and strong spatial dependence. Although PFAS levels are influenced by sociodemographic, industrial, and environmental factors, the relative importance of these drivers remains unclear, highlighting the need for robust statistical tools to identify key predictors from a large candidate set. We present a Bayesian hierarchical framework that integrates censoring into a spatial process model via approximate Gaussian processes and employs a global-local shrinkage prior for high-dimensional variable selection. We evaluate three post-selection strategies, namely, credible interval rules, shrinkage weight thresholds, and clustering-based inclusion and compare their performance in terms of predictive accuracy, censoring robustness, and variable selection stability through cross-validation. Applied to PFOS concentrations in California groundwater, the model identifies a concise, interpretable set of predictors, including demographic composition, industrial facility counts, proximity to airports, traffic density, and environmental features such as herbaceous cover and elevation. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach delivers stable, interpretable inference in censored, spatial, high-dimensional contexts, thereby offering actionable insights into the environmental and industrial factors affecting PFAS concentrations.</p></details> |  |

This approach enriches multimodal embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively. Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset.

Despite the increase in statistical methods designed to identify spatially variable genes, they are mostly based on marginal analysis and share the limitation that the dependence (network) structures among genes are not well accommodated, where a biological process usually involves changes in multiple genes that interact in a complex network. Moreover, the latent cellular composition within spots may introduce confounding variations, negatively affecting identification accuracy. In this study, we develop a novel Bayesian regularization approach for spatial transcriptomic data, with the confounding variations induced by varying cellular distributions effectively corrected. Significantly advancing from the existing studies, a thresholded graph Laplacian regularization is proposed to simultaneously identify spatially variable genes and accommodate the network structure among genes. The proposed method is based on a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution, effectively accommodating the count nature, zero inflation, and overdispersion of spatial transcriptomic data. Extensive simulations and the application to real data demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data.

We introduce $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$, a programming model that realizes spatial networking using bigraphs to express both containment and connectivity, enabling policies to be scoped by physical boundaries, devices to be named by location, the instantiation of spatial services, and the composition of spaces while maintaining local autonomy. Bifr\"ost enables a new class of spatially-aware applications, where co-located devices communicate directly, physical barriers require explicit gateways, and local control bridges to global coordination.</p></details> |  |

This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints.

Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability, efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net, a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records, demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable parameters.

Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., canny edge) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning-based approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. Through an empirical analysis of existing methods, we identify a key limitation: the sampling schedule of condition features, previously unexplored, fails to account for the evolving interplay between structure preservation and domain alignment throughout diffusion steps. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible training-free framework that decouples the sampling schedule of condition features from the denoising process, and systematically investigate the spectrum of feature injection schedules for a higher-quality structure guidance in the feature space. Specifically, we find that condition features sampled from a single timestep are sufficient, yielding a simple yet efficient schedule that balances structure alignment and appearance quality. We further enhance the sampling process by introducing a restart refinement schedule, and improve the visual quality with an appearance-rich prompting strategy. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating the spatial-domain and frequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the model to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To improve lesion detection, we introduce a Multi-Scale Wavelet Spatial Attention (MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at multiple scales. Additionally, a High-Frequency Feature Compensation (HFFC) block is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet decomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracies of 97.82% and 99.58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets, respectively, surpassing existing methods. These results demonstrate the efficacy of WaveNet-SF in addressing the challenges of OCT image analysis and its potential as a powerful tool for retinal disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior work of large language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads, termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational reasoning in LMMs.</p></details> |  |

However, one of the main hesitations regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics. Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Federated modeling offers a practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely, high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments. This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction, adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation and significantly outperforms it in heterogeneous settings, showcasing superior robustness and scalability.</p></details> |  |

However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

This class of applications also holds significant promise of enabling new industries such as augmented reality and robotics. The development of these applications is enabled by a system that can resolve real-world locations to names, or a spatial naming system. Today, mapping platforms provided by organizations like Google and Apple serve as spatial naming systems. These maps are centralized and primarily cover outdoor spaces. We envision that future spatial applications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, would require detailed and precise spatial data across indoor and outdoor spaces. The scale of cartography efforts required to survey indoor spaces and their privacy needs inhibit existing centralized maps from incorporating such spaces into their platform. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of OpenFLAME stands for Open Federated Localization and Mapping Engine, a federated spatial naming system, or in other words, a federated mapping infrastructure. It enables independent parties to manage and serve their own maps of physical regions. This unlocks scalability of map management, isolation, and privacy of maps. The discovery system that identifies maps hosted at a given location is a primary component of our system. We implement OpenFLAME on top of the existing Domain Name System (DNS), which enables us to leverage its existing infrastructure. We implement map services such as address-to-location mapping, routing, and localization on top of our federated mapping infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

Many spatial reasoning tasks depend on fundamental two-dimensional (2D) skills, yet our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art VLMs give implausible or incorrect answers to composite spatial problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans solve effortlessly. To address this, we enhance 2D spatial reasoning in VLMs by training them only on basic spatial capabilities. We first disentangle 2D spatial reasoning into three core components: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. We hypothesize that mastering these skills substantially improves performance on complex spatial tasks that require advanced reasoning and combinatorial problem solving, while also generalizing to real-world scenarios. To test this, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that generates synthetic data to provide targeted supervision across these three capabilities and yields an instruction dataset for each. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned with \emph{Sparkle} improve not only on basic tasks but also on composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These results indicate that enhancing basic spatial skills through synthetic generalization effectively advances complex spatial reasoning and offers a systematic strategy for boosting the spatial understanding of VLMs. Source codes of Sparkle are available at https://github.com/YihongT/Sparkle.</p></details> |  |

Extended Reality (XR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with XR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in XR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to XR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of XR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional covariance-based spatial models, LAMP represents spatial processes by a multiscale ensemble of local models, inspired by geographically weighted regression. To ensure stable model training, larger-scale patterns that are easier to learn are modeled first, followed by smaller-scale patterns, with training terminated once the validation score stops improving. The training procedure, which is based on holdout validation, is easily integrated with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests and neural networks). LAMP training is computationally efficient as it avoids explicit matrix inversion, a major computational bottleneck in conventional GPs. Comparative Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that LAMP, as well as its integration with random forests, achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to an analysis of residential land prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. The R code is available from available from https://github.com/dmuraka/spLAMP_dev_version/tree/main</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle to scale effectively due to two fundamental limitations: a failure to use meaningful basic units to represent movement, and an inability to capture the vast diversity of patterns found in large-scale data. In this work, we develop MoveGPT, a large-scale foundation model specifically architected to overcome these barriers. MoveGPT is built upon two key innovations: (1) a unified location encoder that maps geographically disjoint locations into a shared semantic space, enabling pre-training on a global scale; and (2) a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Transformer that develops specialized experts to efficiently capture diverse mobility patterns. Pre-trained on billion-scale datasets, MoveGPT establishes a new state-of-the-art across a wide range of downstream tasks, achieving performance gains of up to 35% on average. It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to unseen cities. Crucially, our work provides empirical evidence of scaling ability in human mobility, validating a clear path toward building increasingly capable foundation models in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatial models typically treat these barriers as either fully impermeable, completely blocking species movement and dispersal, or entirely absent, which inadequately represents most real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce the Transparent Barrier Model, an extension of spatial Gaussian fields that explicitly incorporates barriers with varying levels of permeability. The model assigns spatially varying range parameters to distinct barrier regions, allowing ecological and geographical knowledge about barrier permeability to directly inform model specifications. This approach maintains computational efficiency by utilizing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) framework combined with stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), ensuring feasible application even in large, complex spatial domains.We demonstrate the practical utility and flexibility of the Transparent Barrier Model through its application to dugong (Dugong dugon) distribution data from the Red Sea.</p></details> |  |

We study why VLMs, such as LLaVA, underutilize spatial cues despite having positional encodings and spatially rich vision encoder features. Our analysis reveals a key imbalance: vision token embeddings have much larger norms than text tokens, suppressing LLM's position embedding. To expose this mechanism, we developed three interpretability tools: (1) the Position Sensitivity Index, which quantifies reliance on token order, (2) the Cross Modality Balance, which reveals attention head allocation patterns, and (3) a RoPE Sensitivity probe, which measures dependence on rotary positional embeddings. These tools uncover that vision tokens and system prompts dominate attention. We validated our mechanistic understanding through targeted interventions that predictably restore positional sensitivity. These findings reveal previously unknown failure modes in multimodal attention and demonstrate how interpretability analysis can guide principled improvements.</p></details> |  |

Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning-based models have achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network (BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can attain a promising performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet, we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the $\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present $\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new $\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.</p></details> |  |

We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |

The benchmark supports visual 3D, 2D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while VLMs perform better on 2D tasks compared to 3D or text-based settings, they struggle with complex spatial configurations and consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This underscores critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition. Project website: https://microcosm.ai/ivispar</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.

Most existing methods either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability of the selected features.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM.

Prior methods focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.</p></details> |  |

This approach is popular due to its simplicity and alignment with public health policies. However, buffer radii are often chosen relatively arbitrarily and assumed constant across the spatial domain. This may result in suboptimal statistical inference if these modeling choices are incorrect. To address this, we develop SVBR (Spatially-Varying Buffer Radii), a flexible hierarchical Bayesian spatial change points approach that treats buffer radii as unknown parameters and allows both radii and exposure effects to vary spatially. Through simulations, we find that SVBR improves estimation and inference for key model parameters compared to traditional methods. We also apply SVBR to study healthcare access in Madagascar, finding that proximity to healthcare facilities generally increases antenatal care usage, with clear spatial variation in this relationship.

Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input -- the varying delay function -- enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the `delayED time' function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This 14 page paper contains 1 table and 9 figures</p></details> |

However, many models often treat the brain as a network of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), neglecting finer spatial properties which can not only increase model complexity but also constrain observable neural dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a spatially extended approach using partial differential equations (PDEs) for both the brain and body. As a case study, we revisit a previously developed model of a child swinging, now incorporating spatial dynamics. By considering the spatio-temporal properties of the brain and body, we analyze how input location and propagation along a PDE influence behavior. This approach offers new insights into the role of spatial organization in adaptive behavior, bridging the gap between abstract neural models and the physical constraints of embodied systems. Our results highlight the importance of spatial dynamics in understanding brain-body-environment interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, Artificial Life Conference 2025, selected for talk</p></details> |
| **[A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589v1)** | 2025-09-29 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.25589v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such, a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</p></details> |  |

SpinBench is designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking, the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs. We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</p></details> |

We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism: visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers. Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger visual grounding.

To address these issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework, integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces, preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and 11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, code link: https://github.com/neu-vi/struct2d</p></details> |

This effect is even more pronounced when the coarse propagator uses a reduced spatial resolution. However, some combinations of spatial discretization and numerical time stepping nevertheless allow for Parareal to converge with monotonically decreasing errors. This raises the question how these configurations can be distinguished theoretically from those where the error initially increases, sometimes over many orders of magnitude. For linear problems, we prove a theorem that implies that the 2-norm of the Parareal iteration matrix is not a suitable tool to predict convergence for hyperbolic problems when spatial coarsening is used. We then show numerical results that suggest that the pseudo-spectral radius can reliably indicate if a given configuration of Parareal will show transient growth or monotonic convergence. For the studied examples, it also provides a good quantitative estimate of the convergence rate in the first few Parareal iterations.</p></details> |  |

Our framework employs spatial processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Learning to Manipulate Object States via Visual Spatial Progress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24129v1)** | 2025-09-28 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.24129v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects: picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time. These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object state manipulation tasks.

In a large-scale evaluation of SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation: current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for offline GCRL.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions, such as fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness. Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts. Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration. Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy.

Such symmetric games commonly arise in real-world interactions between "symmetric" agents who have identically defined utility functions -- such as Bertrand competition, multi-agent performative prediction, and certain congestion games -- and display a rich multiplicity of equilibria despite the seemingly simple setting. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through a first-principles analysis that the exponential weights dynamic, which is popular in online learning, converges in the last iterate for such games regardless of initialization with an appropriately chosen step size. For certain games and/or initializations, we further show that the convergence rate is in fact exponential and holds for any step size. We illustrate our theory with extensive simulations and applications to the aforementioned game-theoretic interactions. In the case of multi-agent performative prediction, we formulate a new "mortgage competition" game between lenders (i.e. banks) who interact with a population of customers, and show that it fits into our framework.</p></details> |  |

With the increasing availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D 120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3% accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing, outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.</p></details> |  |

However, stateless inference often struggles on multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover, task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state, (ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process, where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama, Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations. These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, as these models operate over increasingly extended time horizons, their internal progress becomes opaque to users, complicating expectation management and real-time oversight. In this work, we investigate whether real-time progress prediction is feasible. We discretize progress and train a linear probe to classify reasoning states. We then introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach that enables reasoning models to generate progress estimates (0$\rightarrow$100\%) during inference. Our best fine-tuned model achieves an average error of 10\% for sequences less than 16,000 tokens, offering a practical mechanism for monitoring and interpreting model reasoning in real time.</p></details> |  |

Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals, assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 16 figures, preprint submitted to a journal for review</p></details> |

In the multivariate time series domain, existing approaches often produce counterfactuals that lack validity, plausibility, or intuitive interpretability. We present \textbf{GenFacts}, a novel generative framework for producing plausible and actionable counterfactual explanations for time series classifiers. GenFacts introduces a structured approach to latent space modeling and targeted counterfactual synthesis. We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture recognition as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts consistently outperforms baseline methods in plausibility metrics (+18.7\%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in user studies. These results underscore that realism and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are vital for actionable counterfactuals in time series applications.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world applications often require the generative process to adhere to certain constraints. To this end, we propose a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework that enables scalable inference-time control of discrete diffusion models through principled importance weighting and optimal proposal construction. Specifically, our approach derives tractable importance weights for a range of intermediate targets and characterises the optimal proposal, for which we develop two practical approximations: a first-order gradient-based approximation and an amortised proposal trained to minimise the log-variance of the importance weights. Empirical results across synthetic tasks, language modelling, biology design, and text-to-image generation demonstrate that our framework enhances controllability and sample quality, highlighting the effectiveness of SMC as a versatile recipe for scaling discrete diffusion models at inference time.</p></details> |  |

While prototyping an LLM-based proactive support agent system, we found that existing prototyping and evaluation methods were insufficient to anticipate the nuanced situational complexity and contextual immediacy required. To overcome these challenges, we explored a novel user-centered prototyping approach that combines counterfactual video replay prompting and hybrid Wizard-of-Oz methods to iteratively design and refine agent behaviors.

This paper proposes a hybrid architecture integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer (TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models, with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW, is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series forecasts, being available for future analysis at https://github.com/SFStefenon/CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW .</p></details> |  |

Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.

In a temporal graph there is a set of fixed vertices and the available connections between them change over time in a predefined manner. We observe that, in some cases, shifting some connections, i.e., advancing or delaying them, can decrease the travel time from some vertex (source) to another vertex. We study how we can minimize the maximum time a set of sources needs to reach every vertex, when we are allowed to shift some of the connections. If we restrict the allowed number of changes, we prove that, already for a single source, the problem is NP-hard, and W[2]-hard when parameterized by the number of changes. Then we focus on unconstrained number of changes. We derive a polynomial-time algorithm when there is a single source. When there are two sources, we show that the problem becomes NP-hard; on the other hand, we design an FPT algorithm parameterized by the treewidth of the graph plus the lifetime of the optimal solution, that works for any number of sources. Finally, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for several graph classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version has been published in IJCAI 2023</p></details> |

However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

However, environmental perturbations or execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution. We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure.

These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: RepairAgent, AutoCodeRover, and OpenHands. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2,822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics, such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence of thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection.

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

We propose Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete, particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates; for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time. In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over standard reductions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410v1)** | 2025-10-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.06410v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together, this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities.

State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to AISTATS 2026</p></details> |
| **[Traj-Transformer: Diffusion Models with Transformer for GPS Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06291v1)** | 2025-10-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.06291v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper, we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.</p></details> |  |

RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this 8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55 safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61 plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasi- bility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> |  |

Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |

The dynamics of those agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels. Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents. However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines, and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be preferable.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters journal and presented at the 40th Anniversary of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, which was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 23-26 September, 2024</p></details> |

We present Dynamic Neural Potential Field (NPField-GPT), a learning-enhanced model predictive control (MPC) framework that couples classical optimization with a Transformer-based predictor of footprint-aware repulsive potentials. Given an occupancy sub-map, robot footprint, and optional dynamic-obstacle cues, our autoregressive NPField-GPT head forecasts a horizon of differentiable potentials that are injected into a sequential quadratic MPC program via L4CasADi, yielding real-time, constraint-aware trajectory optimization. We additionally study two baselines: (NPField-D1) static-frame decomposition and (NPField-D2) parallel MLP heads for all steps. In dynamic indoor scenarios from BenchMR and on a Husky UGV in office corridors, NPField-GPT produces safer, more conservative trajectories under motion changes, while D1/D2 offer lower latency. We also compare with the CIAO* and MPPI baselines. Across methods, the Transformer+MPC synergy preserves the transparency and stability of model-based planning while learning only the part that benefits from data: spatiotemporal collision risk.

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing.

Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al.

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.</p></details> |  |

A multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.

However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |

In this framework, each agent in a multi-agent system is assigned a partial trajectory offline and locally approximates the unknown dynamics using a deep neural network within the Koopman operator framework. By exchanging local estimated dynamics rather than training data, agents achieve consensus on a global dynamics model without sharing their private training trajectories. Simulation studies on a surface vehicle demonstrate that DDKL-PT attains consensus with respect to the learned dynamics, with each agent achieving reasonably small approximation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, a model predictive control scheme is developed by integrating the learned Koopman dynamics with known kinematic relations. Results on goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks support that the distributedly learned dynamics are sufficiently accurate for model-based optimal control.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.

Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) offers a more robust alternative by directly leveraging noisy binary comparisons over trajectories. We study the best policy identification problem in PbRL, motivated by post-training optimization of generative models, for example, during multi-turn interactions. Learning in this setting combines an offline preference dataset--potentially biased or out-of-distribution and collected from a rater of subpar 'competence'--with online pure exploration, making systematic online learning essential. To this end, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling that maintains posteriors over the reward model and dynamics. We provide the first Bayesian simple regret guarantees for PbRL and introduce an efficient approximation that outperforms existing baselines on simulation and image generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Their distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including distinguishing between different models as well as between different checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different settings validate the utility of our methods.</p></details> |  |

We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools. Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user preferences.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k.

Advances in robot performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e., behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency, non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown.

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models have recently demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment. This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS.

The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset, modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific driving scenes.

While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework. Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short- and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data scales in robot policy learning.

However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.</p></details> | Fig.3 updated |

LPT offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories.

To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy, first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories, enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness.

Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |

The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of ``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm} (\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by 10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory manipulation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |

Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

A prominent line of research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward hacking.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  |

By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</p></details> |  |

This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - LATent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Experiments on several benchmarks, such as GenImage, Chameleon, and Diffusion Forensics, show that LATTE achieves superior performance, especially in challenging cross-generator and cross-dataset scenarios, highlighting the potential of latent trajectory modeling.

While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.</p></details> |  |

Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance, where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on the comprehensive OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27), once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in 2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting. While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |

The method concurrently estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity.

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct.

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While LLM agents show decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications. Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction approach to reduce the cost of agents. Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless, redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction for agent systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

However, their training paradigm mainly relies on manually collected successful demonstrations, making it difficult to adapt to complex environments when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or execution biases. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a closed-loop optimization framework via active trial-and-error mechanism, it suffers from sparse rewards, high variance, and unstable optimization in long-horizon robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Trajectory-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO), an online RL-based training framework for VLA models. TGRPO leverages task analysis generated by a large language model to automatically construct dense reward functions, providing fine-grained feedback to accelerate convergence and improve credit assignment. The core of our method is a group-based strategy that samples and normalizes multiple trajectories in parallel, reducing variance through relative comparison. By integrating trajectory-level and step-level advantage estimation, TGRPO captures both global and local optimization signals without relying on a value network. Experiments on four task categories of the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO achieves an average success rate of 80.7\%, which is 4.2\% higher than that of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and outperforms other representative RL-based post-training methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve 78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score) classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.</p></details> | 13 pages |

This is because solar energy reduces electrical consumption and provides free energy, while also lowering carbon emissions to create a more sustainable environment. This paper aims to analyze the 2.72kW p rooftop grid-tied PV system performance between 2020 and 2023 in Tarlac City, Philippines. The PV generated yearly is measured by Array Yield (YA), Reference Yield (YR), and Final Yield (YF), which were found to be valued at 3.12, 3.9, and 3.01 kWh/kWp, respectively. The efficiency can decrease due to System Loss (LS) and Capture Loss (LC), which were 0.78 and 0.12 kWh/kWp, respectively. This results in a Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) of 15.52% and a Performance Ratio (PR) of 77.10%. The productivity of PV resulted in an array efficiency was 12.89%, an inverter efficiency was 94.3%, and a system efficiency was 12.16%. PV energy generation was 3,699 kWh, with 2380 kWh fed into the grid annually. The system's annual revenue is $690.59. The payback period is 6 years with a 238.2% Return On Investment (ROI). Carbon emissions are reduced by 0.379 tCO2/kWp/yr.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, Published with International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology (IJETT)</p></details> |

The expansion of charging station networks, especially in large cities, creates serious logistical challenges for charging point operators (CPOs) in planning maintenance and repair activities. Inefficient field personnel management can lead to time loss, high operational costs, and resource waste. This study presents an integrated method to optimize the planning of EV charging network maintenance operations. The proposed approach groups charging stations according to geographical proximity using the K-means clustering algorithm and calculates the shortest routes between clusters using a genetic algorithm. The method was developed in Python and applied to a dataset consisting of 100 EV charging stations in Istanbul. Considering the population density, traffic density, and resource constraints of Istanbul, the route planning approach presented in this study has great potential, especially for such metropolises. According to the different parameter configurations tested, the most efficient scenario provided approximately 35\% distance savings compared to the reference route created according to the sequential data layout. While the reference route provides a simple comparison, the study presents a solution that will enable field operations in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul to be conducted in a more efficient, planned and scalable manner. In future studies, it is planned to integrate real-time factors such as traffic conditions and field technician constraints.</p></details> |  |

This study examines transitions between returners, who repeatedly visit a limited set of locations, and explorers, who travel across broader destinations, over a 15-day emergency period in a densely populated metropolitan region using the YJMob100K dataset. High-resolution spatial data reveal intra-urban behavioral dynamics often masked at coarser scales. Beyond static comparisons, we analyze how mobility evolves over time, with varying emergency durations, across weekdays and weekends, and relative to neighborhood boundaries, linking the analysis to the 15-minute city framework. Results show that at least two weeks of data are required to detect meaningful behavioral shifts. During prolonged emergencies, individuals resume visits to non-essential locations more slowly than under normal conditions. Explorers markedly reduce long distance travel, while weekends and holidays consistently exhibit returner-like, short distance patterns. Residents of low Points of Interest (POI) density neighborhoods often travel to POI rich areas, highlighting spatial disparities. Strengthening local accessibility may improve urban resilience during crises. Full reproducibility is supported through the project website: https://github.com/wissamkontar</p></details> |  |

An urban area is considered a ``15-minute city" if every resident can access essential services within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from their home. However, there is an ongoing debate about the effectiveness of this model in reducing car usage and carbon emissions. In this study, we conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis to evaluate the impact of service proximity to homes on CO$_2$ emissions. By examining nearly 400 cities worldwide, we discover that, within the same city, areas with services located closer to residents produce less CO$_2$ emissions per capita from transportation. We establish a clear relationship between the proximity of services and CO$_2$ emissions for each city. Additionally, we quantify the potential reduction in emissions for 30 cities if they optimise the location of their services. This optimisation maintains each city's total number of services while redistributing them to ensure equal accessibility throughout the entire urban area. Our findings indicate that improving the proximity of services can significantly reduce expected urban emissions related to transportation.</p></details> |  |

While recent progress on SLAM has been swift, academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors. We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale. This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at https://www.lamaria.ethz.ch.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development. Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as beautiful and safety.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on resource-constrained mobile devices in real-time remains a significant challenge due to two compute-intensive stages: level-of-detail (LoD) search and rasterization. In this paper, we propose Voyager, an effective solution to accelerate city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians within the view frustum remains roughly constant. Leveraging this temporal correlation, we propose a temporal-aware LoD search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the remaining rendering stages. For the remaining rendering process, we accelerate the bottleneck stage, rasterization, via preemptive $\alpha$-filtering. With all optimizations above, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves up to 6.6$\times$ speedup and 85\% energy savings with superior rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

In this context, the main objective of this study is to propose an innovative methodology to automatically evaluate the level of digital transformation (DT) in public sector organizations. The proposed approach combines traditional assessment methods with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The methodology follows a dual approach: on the one hand, surveys are conducted using specialized staff from various public entities; on the other, AI-based models (including neural networks and transformer architectures) are used to estimate the DT level of the organizations automatically. Our approach has been applied to a real-world case study involving local public administrations in the Valencian Community (Spain) and shown effective performance in assessing DT. While the proposed methodology has been validated in a specific local context, its modular structure and dual-source data foundation support its international scalability, acknowledging that administrative, regulatory, and DT maturity factors may condition its broader applicability. The experiments carried out in this work include (i) the creation of a domain-specific corpus derived from the surveys and websites of several organizations, used to train the proposed models; (ii) the use and comparison of diverse AI methods; and (iii) the validation of our approach using real data. The integration of technologies such as the IoT, sensor networks, and AI-based analytics can significantly support resilient, agile urban environments and the transition towards more effective and sustainable Smart City models.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures |

However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Residents of Atlanta and DeKalb County, environmental activists, police and prison abolitionists, and other activists and concerned individuals formed the movement in opposition to the facility, known as the Stop Cop City / Defend the Atlanta Forest movement. Social media and digital maps became common tools for communicating information about the facility and the movement. Here, we examine online maps about the facility and the opposition movement, originating from grassroots organizations, the City of Atlanta, news media outlets, the Atlanta Police Foundation, and individuals. We gather and examine 32 publicly available maps collected through the Google Search API, Twitter (now X), Instagram and reddit. Using a framework of critical cartography, we conduct a content analysis of these maps to identify the mapping technologies and techniques (data, cartographic elements, styles) used by different stakeholders and roles that maps and mapping technologies can play in social movements. We examine the extent to which these maps provide data to confirm or contradict concerns raised by grassroots organizations and local residents about the facility. We find that stakeholders and mapmakers use geospatial tools in different ways and likely have varied access to mapping technologies. We argue that documenting the use of maps to communicate information about a contentious project can help enumerate community positions and perspectives, and we advocate for accessible mapmaking tools. We conclude by discussing the implications of accessibility of mapping technology and posting maps to social media, and share example map images that extend the geographic information systems (GIS) techniques seen in the retrieved maps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PCQ294</p></details> |

In addition to citizen engagement, a smart city enables connected infrastructure, data-driven decision making and smart mobility. For most of these features, network data plays a critical role, particularly from public Wi-Fi infrastructures, where cities can benefit from optimized services such as public transport management and the safety and efficiency of large events. One of the biggest concerns in developing a smart city is using secure and private data. This is particularly relevant in the case of Wi-Fi network data, where sensitive information can be collected. This paper specifically addresses the problem of sharing secure data to enhance the quality of the Wi-Fi network in a city. Despite the high importance of this type of data, related work focuses on improving the safety of mobility patterns, targeting only the protection of MAC addresses. On the opposite side, we provide a practical methodology for safeguarding all attributes in real Wi-Fi network data. This study was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of legal experts, data custodians and technical privacy specialists, resulting in high-quality data. On top of that, we show how to integrate the legal considerations for secure data sharing. Our approach promotes data-driven innovation and privacy awareness in the context of smart city initiatives, which have been tested in a real scenario.</p></details> |  |

Using compressed transformer models and Llama-3-8B for annotation, we classify sentiment across heterogeneous text domains. Our pipeline handles long-form and short-form text, supports consistent annotation, and enables reproducible evaluation. We benchmark five models (DistilRoBERTa, DistilBERT, MiniLM, ELECTRA, TinyBERT) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1-score, AUC, and training time. DistilRoBERTa achieved the highest F1 (0.8292), TinyBERT the best efficiency, and MiniLM the best cross-platform consistency.

We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring equal selection probability for constituents ex ante. We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.</p></details> |  |
| **[VoxCity: A Seamless Framework for Open Geospatial Data Integration, Grid-Based Semantic 3D City Model Generation, and Urban Environment Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13934v2)** | 2025-09-09 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.13934v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional urban environment simulation is a powerful tool for informed urban planning. However, the intensive manual effort required to prepare input 3D city models has hindered its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we present VoxCity, an open-source Python package that provides a one-stop solution for grid-based 3D city model generation and urban environment simulation for cities worldwide. VoxCity's `generator' subpackage automatically downloads building heights, tree canopy heights, land cover, and terrain elevation within a specified target area, and voxelizes buildings, trees, land cover, and terrain to generate an integrated voxel city model. The `simulator' subpackage enables users to conduct environmental simulations, including solar radiation and view index analyses. Users can export the generated models using several file formats compatible with external software, such as ENVI-met (INX), Blender, and Rhino (OBJ). We generated 3D city models for eight global cities, and demonstrated the calculation of solar irradiance, sky view index, and green view index. We also showcased microclimate simulation and 3D rendering visualization through ENVI-met and Rhino, respectively, through the file export function. Additionally, we reviewed openly available geospatial data to create guidelines to help users choose appropriate data sources depending on their target areas and purposes. VoxCity can significantly reduce the effort and time required for 3D city model preparation and promote the utilization of urban environment simulations. This contributes to more informed urban and architectural design that considers environmental impacts, and in turn, fosters sustainable and livable cities. VoxCity is released openly at https://github.com/kunifujiwara/VoxCity.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Deep Neural Network with Frequency-Aware Channel and Spatial Refinement for Flood Prediction in Sustainable Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08003v1)** | 2025-09-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.08003v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore, existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components: (1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively, surpassing existing methods by significant margins.</p></details> |  |

Conventional fixes enlarge the training set or replay past data, but these strategies incur high data collection costs, sample inefficiently and fail to balance long- and short-term experience, leaving them short of human-like continual learning. Here we introduce Dual-LS, a task-free, online continual learning paradigm for DNN-based motion forecasting that is inspired by the complementary learning system of the human brain. Dual-LS pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval while dynamically coordinating long-term and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on naturalistic data spanning three countries, over 772,000 vehicles and cumulative testing mileage of 11,187 km show that Dual-LS mitigates catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31\% and reduces computational resource demand by up to 94.02\%, markedly boosting predictive stability in vehicle motion forecasting without inflating data requirements. Meanwhile, it endows DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting with computation efficient and human-like continual learning adaptability fit for smart cities.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations. Leveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of downstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban simulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 4D cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

| **[IoT-based Noise Monitoring using Mobile Nodes for Smart Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00979v1)** | 2025-08-31 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.00979v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals. The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle. To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali. Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling effective noise pollution management and urban planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanInsight: A Distributed Edge Computing Framework with LLM-Powered Data Filtering for Smart City Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00936v1)** | 2025-08-31 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.00936v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale, latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge, LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources. Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation, this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable smart infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

It is common that large software systems offer a web interface for user interaction. Usually, available web interfaces are not regarded in software visualization tools. This paper introduces additions to the web-based live tracing software visualization tool ExplorViz: We add an embedded web view for instrumented applications in the 3D visualization to ease interaction with the given applications and enable the exploration of the thereby displayed HTML content. Namely, the Document Object Model (DOM) is visualized via a three-dimensional representation of the HTML structure in same-origin contexts. Our visualization approach is evaluated in a preliminary user study. The study results give insights into the potential use cases, benefits, and shortcomings of our implemented approach. Based on our study results, we propose directions for further research to support the visual exploration of web interfaces and explore use cases for the combined visualization of software cities and HTML structure.

| **[Semantic Zoom and Mini-Maps for Software Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00003v1)** | 2025-08-26 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.00003v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software visualization tools can facilitate program comprehension by providing visual metaphors, or abstractions that reduce the amount of textual data that needs to be processed mentally. One way they do this is by enabling developers to build an internal representation of the visualized software and its architecture. However, as the amount of displayed data in the visualization increases, the visualization itself can become more difficult to comprehend. The ability to display small and large amounts of data in visualizations is called visual scalability. In this paper, we present two approaches to address the challenge of visual scalability in 3D software cities. First, we present an approach to semantic zoom, in which the graphical representation of the software landscape changes based on the virtual camera's distance from visual objects. Second, we augment the visualization with a miniature two-dimensional top-view projection called mini-map. We demonstrate our approach using an open-source implementation in our software visualization tool ExplorViz. ExplorViz is web-based and uses the 3D city metaphor, focusing on live trace visualization. We evaluated our approaches in two separate user studies. The results indicate that semantic zoom and the mini-map are both useful additions. User feedback indicates that semantic zoom and mini-maps are especially useful for large software landscapes and collaborative software exploration. The studies indicate a good usability of our implemented approaches. However, some shortcomings in our implementations have also been discovered, to be addressed in future work.

| **[Digital Twin-Guided Energy Management over Real-Time Pub/Sub Protocol in 6G Smart Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18516v1)** | 2025-08-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.18516v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the emergence of 6G IoT networks has accelerated the deployment of enhanced smart city services, the resource limitations of IoT devices remain as a significant problem. Given this limitation, meeting the low-latency service requirement of 6G networks becomes even more challenging. However, existing 6G IoT management strategies lack real-time operation and mostly rely on discrete actions, which are insufficient to optimise energy consumption. To address these, in this study, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-guided energy management framework to jointly handle the low latency and energy efficiency challenges in 6G IoT networks. In this framework, we provide the twin models through a distributed overlay network and handle the dynamic updates between the data layer and the upper layers of the DT over the Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) protocol. We also design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine with a novel formulated reward function to provide optimal data update times for each of the IoT devices. The RL engine receives a diverse set of environment states from the What-if engine and runs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to output continuous actions to the IoT devices. Based on our simulation results, we observe that the proposed framework achieves a 37% improvement in 95th percentile latency and a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to the existing literature.</p></details> |  |

However, as DTs take active roles in control loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic and adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing authentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require centralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable physical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and distributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a lightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to establish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs without relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind significantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and 4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines, while maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower. These findings highlight its suitability for future smart city deployments requiring efficient, resilient, and trustworthy DT authentication.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, Accepted by IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.</p></details> |  |

It then evolved rapidly by including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different application domains and research communities, acknowledging the interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the Model-Driven Engineering community.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the quality and biases of AI-generated Open Building Datasets (OBDs) generated by Google and Microsoft against OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, across diverse global cities including Accra, Nairobi, Caracas, Berlin, and Houston. The Intersection over Union (IoU), overlap analysis and a positional accuracy algorithm are used to analyse the similarity and alignment of the datasets. The paper also analyses the size distribution of the building polygon area, and completeness using predefined but regular spatial units. The results indicate significant variance in data quality, with Houston and Berlin demonstrating high alignment and completeness, reflecting their structured urban environments. There are gaps in the datasets analysed, and cities like Accra and Caracas may be under-represented. This could highlight difficulties in capturing complex or informal regions. The study also notes different building size distributions, which may be indicative of the global socio-economic divide. These findings may emphasise the need to consider the quality of global building datasets to avoid misrepresentation, which is an important element of planning and resource distribution.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 pages |

As cities increasingly deploy artificial intelligence (AI) systems, concerns around equity, accountability, and normative legitimacy are growing. This paper introduces the Urban Reasonableness Layer (URL), a conceptual framework that adapts the legal "reasonable person" standard for supervisory oversight in municipal AI systems, including potential future implementations of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Drawing on historical analogies, scenario mapping, and participatory norm-setting, we explore how legal and community-derived standards can inform AI decision-making in urban contexts. Rather than prescribing a fixed solution, the URL is proposed as an exploratory architecture for negotiating contested values, aligning automation with democratic processes, and interrogating the limits of technical alignment. Our key contributions include: (1) articulating the conceptual and operational architecture of the URL; (2) specifying participatory mechanisms for dynamic normative threshold-setting; (3) presenting a comparative scenario analysis of governance trajectories; and (4) outlining evaluation metrics and limitations. This work contributes to ongoing debates on urban AI governance by foregrounding pluralism, contestability, and the inherently political nature of socio-technical systems.</p></details> |  |

These drones must intercept/eliminate the threat, thus reducing potential damage from the attack. We model this as a Sequential Stackelberg Security Game, where the defender first commits to a mixed sequential defense strategy, and the attacker then best responds. We develop an efficient algorithm called S2D2, which outputs a defense strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of S2D2 in extensive experiments on data from 80 real cities, improving the performance of the defender in comparison to greedy heuristics based on prior works. We prove that under some reasonable assumptions about the city structure, S2D2 outputs an approximate Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) with a convenient structure.</p></details> | 59 pages, 10 figures |

Generative AI (GenAI) significantly enhances this potential, moving beyond traditional AI analytics and predictions by processing multimodal content and generating novel outputs like text and simulations. Using specialized or foundational models, GenAI's natural language abilities such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) can power tailored applications and unified interfaces, dramatically lowering barriers for users interacting with complex smart city systems. In this paper, we focus on GenAI applications based on conversational interfaces within the context of three critical user archetypes in a Smart City - Citizens, Operators and Planners. We identify and review GenAI models and techniques that have been proposed or deployed for various urban subsystems in the contexts of these user archetypes. We also consider how GenAI can be built on the existing data foundation of official city records, IoT data streams and Urban Digital Twins.

However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Kahn and Anne Tyng](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08561v1)** | 2025-08-12 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.08561v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a study of computation and morphology of Louis Kahn City Tower project. The City Tower is an unbuilt design by Louis I. Kahn and Anne Tyng that integrates form and structure using 3D space triangular geometries. Although never built, the City Tower geometrical framework anticipated later developments in design of space-frame structures. Initially envisioned in the 1950s, the City Tower project is a skyscraper structure based on a tetrahedral and octahedral space frame called Octet-Truss. The aim of this study is to analyze the geometry of the City Tower structure and how it can be used to develop modular and adaptable architectural forms. The study is based on an analytical shape grammar that is used to recreate the original structure, and later to generate new structural configurations based on the City Tower's morphology. This study also investigates the potential applications of these findings in architecture and reveals the possibilities of using tetrahedrons and octahedrons as fundamental geometries for creating scalable and modular designs and presents initial findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, ARCC Conference</p></details> |

The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, the inherent randomness, non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniMove/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

We hypothesize that street view imagery -- an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer relationships between specific types of social interactions and built environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant cities.</p></details> |  |

This paper leverages network science to conduct a multi-modal analysis of San Diego's transportation system. We construct a multi-layer graph using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), representing driving, walking, and public transit layers. By integrating thousands of Points of Interest (POIs), we analyze network accessibility, structure, and resilience through centrality measures, community detection, and a proposed metric for walkability. Our analysis reveals a system defined by a stark core-periphery divide. We find that while the urban core is well-integrated, 30.3% of POIs are isolated from public transit within a walkable distance, indicating significant equity gaps in suburban and rural access. Centrality analysis highlights the driving network's over-reliance on critical freeways as bottlenecks, suggesting low network resilience, while confirming that San Diego is not a broadly walkable city. Furthermore, community detection demonstrates that transportation mode dictates the scale of mobility, producing compact, local clusters for walking and broad, regional clusters for driving. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing urban mobility systems, offering quantitative insights that can inform targeted interventions to improve transportation equity and infrastructure resilience in San Diego.</p></details> |  |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.</p></details> |  |

Conventional smart city mapping techniques, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth. However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei. We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields 40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and (iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work partly supported by the RA Science Committee grant No. 22rl-052 (DISTAL) and the EU under Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan of NextGenerationEU on "Telecommunications of the Future" (PE00000001 - program "RESTART")</p></details> |

While traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable, fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities. This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor. Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\% improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score of predicting immobility compared to the baselines.

We are not trying to reproduce existing cities, but to generate artificial cities that are convincing and plausible by capturing developmental behavior. In addition, our results are meant to build upon themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments, whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions. With the aid of agent based simulation we are generating a system of agents and behaviors that interact with one another through their effects upon a simulated environment. Our philosophy is that as each agent follows a simple behavioral rule set, a more complex behavior will tend to emerge out of the interactions between the agents and their differing rule sets. By confining our model to a set of simple rules for each class of agents, we hope to make our model extendible not only in regard to the types of structures that are produced, but also in describing the social and cultural influences prevalent in all cities</p></details> |  |

Yet existing methods face key limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning, UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.</p></details> |  |

An Agent-Based Simulation of Human Mobility in a Futuristic Smart City](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143v1)** | 2025-07-20 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.15143v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to 8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70 percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.</p></details> |  |

Applications to urban science are numerous, from facilitating comparisons between delineated districts and administrative divisions to informing policymakers of the shifting economic and labor landscapes. In this study, we propose using commute networks sourced from the census for the purpose of urban delineation, by modeling them with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. We derive low-dimensional representations of granular urban areas (nodes) using GNNs. Subsequently, nodes' embeddings are clustered to identify spatially cohesive communities in urban areas. Our experiments across the U.S. demonstrate the effectiveness of network embeddings in capturing significant socioeconomic disparities between communities in various cities, particularly in factors such as median household income. The role of census mobility data in regional delineation is also noted, and we establish the utility of GNNs in urban community detection, as a powerful alternative to existing methods in this domain. The results offer insights into the wider effects of commute networks and their use in building meaningful representations of urban regions.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m, achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation.

Consequently, reusing existing infrastructures to develop alternative communication strategies after disasters is essential to minimise the impact of these events on the population's ability to communicate and promptly receive alerts from authorities. In this context, the emergence of smart cities, characterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents significant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient architecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network, whose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication system to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video) between citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote monitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled flooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and tested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor environments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of obstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average latency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and 726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow network, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all functionalities associated with the HaLert architecture. The tests conducted on the LoRa network revealed a high average message success rate of 94.96%.</p></details> |  |

Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP). However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data (TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions. Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

This study compares iNETs across platforms (Google Places and Foursquare) and spatial granularities, showing that coarser levels reveal more consistent cross-platform patterns, while finer granularities expose subtle, platform-specific behaviors. Our analysis finds that, in general, user interest is primarily shaped by geographic proximity and venue similarity, while socioeconomic and political contexts play a lesser role. Building on these insights, we develop a multi-level, explainable recommendation system that predicts high-interest urban regions for different user types. The model adapts to behavior profiles -- such as explorers, who are driven by proximity, and returners, who prefer familiar venues -- and provides natural-language explanations using explainable AI (XAI) techniques. To support our approach, we introduce h3-cities, a tool for multi-scale spatial analysis, and release a public demo for interactively exploring personalized urban recommendations.

However, most existing methods rely heavily on neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image, achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

The cities were selected for their diverse economic profiles and hospitality dynamics. Monthly data from 2018 to 2025 were used, with 80% for training and 20% for testing. Advanced time series decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban hospitality forecasting and provide a comparative framework for data-driven decision-making.

| **[LoD-Loc v2: Aerial Visual Localization over Low Level-of-Detail City Models using Explicit Silhouette Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00659v1)** | 2025-07-01 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.00659v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models. However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes. Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2 improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches are typically limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to support trip-level simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We study this interaction by simulating human drivers and AVs. Our experiments with standard MARL algorithms reveal that, both in simplified and complex networks, policies often fail to converge to an optimal solution or require long training periods. This problem is amplified by the fact that we cannot rely entirely on simulated training, as there are no accurate models of human routing behavior. At the same time, real-world training in cities risks destabilizing urban traffic systems, increasing externalities, such as $CO_2$ emissions, and introducing non-stationarity as human drivers will adapt unpredictably to AV behaviors. In this position paper, we argue that city authorities must collaborate with the ML community to monitor and critically evaluate the routing algorithms proposed by car companies toward fair and system-efficient routing algorithms and regulatory standards.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the design considerations and engagement opportunities of public service chatbots, using a 311 chatbot from a metropolitan city as a case study. Our qualitative study consisted of official survey data and 16 interviews examining stakeholder experiences and design preferences for the chatbot. We found two key areas of concern regarding these public chatbots: individual-level and community-level. At the individual level, citizens experience three key challenges: interpretation, transparency, and social contextualization. Moreover, the current chatbot design prioritizes the efficient completion of individual tasks but neglects the broader community perspective. It overlooks how individuals interact and discuss problems collectively within their communities. To address these concerns, we offer design opportunities for creating more intelligent, transparent, community-oriented chatbots that better engage individuals and their communities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-directional Mapping of Morphology Metrics and 3D City Blocks for Enhanced Characterization and Generation of Urban Form](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15801v2)** | 2025-06-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.15801v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban morphology, examining city spatial configurations, links urban design to sustainability. Morphology metrics play a fundamental role in performance-driven computational urban design (CUD) which integrates urban form generation, performance evaluation and optimization. However, a critical gap remains between performance evaluation and complex urban form generation, caused by the disconnection between morphology metrics and urban form, particularly in metric-to-form workflows. It prevents the application of optimized metrics to generate improved urban form with enhanced urban performance. Formulating morphology metrics that not only effectively characterize complex urban forms but also enable the reconstruction of diverse forms is of significant importance. This paper highlights the importance of establishing a bi-directional mapping between morphology metrics and complex urban form to enable the integration of urban form generation with performance evaluation. We present an approach that can 1) formulate morphology metrics to both characterize urban forms and in reverse, retrieve diverse similar 3D urban forms, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of morphology metrics in representing 3D urban form characteristics of blocks by comparison. We demonstrate the methodology with 3D urban models of New York City, covering 14,248 blocks. We use neural networks and information retrieval for morphology metric encoding, urban form clustering and morphology metric evaluation. We identified an effective set of morphology metrics for characterizing block-scale urban forms through comparison. The proposed methodology tightly couples complex urban forms with morphology metrics, hence it can enable a seamless and bidirectional relationship between urban form generation and optimization in performance-driven urban design towards sustainable urban design and planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Acoustic Scene Classification with City Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16862v2)** | 2025-06-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.16862v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acoustic scene recordings are often collected from a diverse range of cities. Most existing acoustic scene classification (ASC) approaches focus on identifying common acoustic scene patterns across cities to enhance generalization. However, the potential acoustic differences introduced by city-specific environmental and cultural factors are overlooked. In this paper, we hypothesize that the city-specific acoustic features are beneficial for the ASC task rather than being treated as noise or bias. To this end, we propose City2Scene, a novel framework that leverages city features to improve ASC. Unlike conventional approaches that may discard or suppress city information, City2Scene transfers the city-specific knowledge from pre-trained city classification models to scene classification model using knowledge distillation. We evaluate City2Scene on three datasets of DCASE Challenge Task 1, which include both scene and city labels. Experimental results demonstrate that city features provide valuable information for classifying scenes. By distilling city-specific knowledge, City2Scene effectively improves accuracy across a variety of lightweight CNN backbones, achieving competitive performance to the top-ranked solutions of DCASE Challenge in recent years.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we analyze traffic incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in improving classification reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures.

This trend makes it essential for regulators to focus on these interactions to manage smart city practices effectively and prevent unethical outcomes. To facilitate ethical analysis for smart city applications, this paper introduces a judgment framework that examines various scenarios where ethical issues may arise. Employing a multi-agent approach, the framework incorporates diverse social entities and applies logic-based ethical rules to identify potential violations. Through a rights-based analysis, we developed a set of 13 ethical principles and rules to guide ethical practices in smart cities. We utilized two specification languages, Prototype Verification System (PVS) and Alloy, to model our multi-agent system. Our analysis suggests that Alloy may be more efficient for formalizing smart cities and conducting ethical rule checks, particularly with the assistance of a human evaluator. Simulations of a real-world smart city application demonstrate that our ethical judgment framework effectively detects unethical outcomes and can be extended for practical use.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning-based methods have shown considerable promise, most existing approaches produce deterministic point estimates, thereby neglecting the uncertainty arising from unobserved traffic flows. Furthermore, current models are typically trained in a city-specific manner, which hinders their generalizability and limits scalability across diverse urban contexts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TrafficPPT, a Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer designed to model traffic volume as a distributional aggregation of trajectories. Our framework fuses heterogeneous data sources-including real-time observations, historical trajectory data, and road network topology-enabling robust and uncertainty-aware traffic inference. TrafficPPT is initially pretrained on large-scale simulated data spanning multiple urban scenarios, and later fine-tuned on target cities to ensure effective domain adaptation. Experiments on real-world datasets show that TrafficPPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under conditions of extreme data sparsity.

Through semi-structured interviews with thirty-six employees from ten departments of a U.S. city government, our findings reveal challenges employees face when operationalizing equity, perspectives on data needs for advancing equity goals, and the design space for acceptable government technology.

To address this gap, we introduce DVL-Suite, a comprehensive framework for analyzing long-term urban dynamics through remote sensing imagery. Our suite comprises 15,063 high-resolution (1.0m) multi-temporal images spanning 42 megacities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2023, organized into two components: DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes seven urban understanding tasks, from fundamental change detection (pixel-level) to quantitative analyses (regional-level) and comprehensive urban narratives (scene-level), capturing diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster assessment, and environmental challenges. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art multimodal large language models and reveal their limitations in long-term temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon this dataset, we develop DVLChat, a baseline model capable of both image-level question-answering and pixel-level segmentation, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of city dynamics through language interactions.</p></details> |  |

The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822v1)** | 2025-05-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.20822v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their role in wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this inter-connectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. Here, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population--crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher crime levels. Specifically, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population constant. We show that models incorporating both population and commuter inflows better explain crime variation than population-only models. These findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population--crime relationship.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

It has become more destructive during large-scale events such as the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest religious gatherings. This event's popularity has attracted millions worldwide, leading to significant and un-predictable accumulation of waste. Such a tremendous number of visitors leads to in-creased waste management issues at the Grand Mosque and other holy sites, highlighting the need for an effective solution other than traditional methods based on rigid collection schedules. To address this challenge, this research proposed an innovative solution that is context-specific and tailored to the unique requirements of pilgrimage season: a Smart Waste Management System, called TUHR, that utilizes the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This system encompasses ultrasonic sensors that monitor waste levels in each container at the performance sites. Once the container reaches full capacity, the sensor communicates with the microcontroller, which alerts the relevant authorities. Moreover, our system can detect harmful substances such as gas from the gas detector sensor. Such a proactive and dynamic approach promises to mitigate the environmental and health risks associated with waste accumulation and enhance the cleanliness of these sites. It also delivers economic benefits by reducing unnecessary gasoline consumption and optimizing waste management resources. Importantly, this research aligns with the principles of smart cities and exemplifies the innovative, sustainable, and health-conscious approach that Saudi Arabia is implementing as part of its Vision 2030 initiative.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Unity game engine-based simulation is used for direct collision modeling. A custom reward enabled reinforcement learning method, proximal policy optimization (PPO) model, yields substantial improvements over baseline results, reducing the number of serious collisions, number of vehicle-vehicle collisions, and total distance travelled by over 3 times the baseline values. The model also improves fuel efficiency by 39% and reduces carbon emissions by 88%. Results establish feasibility for city-wide 3D traffic simulation applications incorporating the vision-zero safety principles of the Department of Transportation, including physics-informed, adaptable, realistic collision modeling, as well as appropriate reward modeling for real-world traffic signal light control towards reducing collisions, optimizing traffic flow and reducing greenhouse emissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, figures at end, methods at end.

To bridge this gap, we introduce CityEQA, a new task where an embodied agent answers open-vocabulary questions through active exploration in dynamic city spaces. To support this task, we present CityEQA-EC, the first benchmark dataset featuring 1,412 human-annotated tasks across six categories, grounded in a realistic 3D urban simulator. Moreover, we propose Planner-Manager-Actor (PMA), a novel agent tailored for CityEQA. PMA enables long-horizon planning and hierarchical task execution: the Planner breaks down the question answering into sub-tasks, the Manager maintains an object-centric cognitive map for spatial reasoning during the process control, and the specialized Actors handle navigation, exploration, and collection sub-tasks. Experiments demonstrate that PMA achieves 60.7% of human-level answering accuracy, significantly outperforming competitive baselines. While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for enhanced visual reasoning in CityEQA. This work paves the way for future advancements in urban spatial intelligence.
