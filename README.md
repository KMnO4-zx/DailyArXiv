| **[Time-Varying Confounding Bias in Observational Geoscience with Application to Induced Seismicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16360v1)** | 2025-10-18 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.16360v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evidence derived primarily from physical models has identified saltwater disposal as the dominant causal factor that contributes to induced seismicity. To complement physical models, statistical/machine learning (ML) models are designed to measure associations from observational data, either with parametric regression models or more flexible ML models. However, it is often difficult to interpret the statistical significance of a parameter or the predicative power of a model as evidence of causation. We adapt a causal inference framework with the potential outcomes perspective to explicitly define what we meant by causal effect and declare necessary identification conditions to recover unbiased causal effect estimates. In particular, we illustrate the threat of time-varying confounding in observational longitudinal geoscience data through simulations and adapt established statistical methods for longitudinal analysis from the causal interference literature to estimate the effect of wastewater disposal on earthquakes in the Fort-Worth Basin of North Central Texas from 2013 to 2016.</p></details> |  |

Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

We are encouraged to observe that earth scientists from developing countries have gained better visibility in the recent AI for Science (AI4S) paradigm and that AI is also improving the landscape of international collaboration in geoscience-related research.</p></details> | <details><summary>misco...</summary><p>miscommunication in the authorization process from the first author</p></details> |
| **[RAG for Geoscience: What We Expect, Gaps and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11246v1)** | 2025-08-15 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.11246v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by combining retrieval with generation. However, its current workflow remains largely text-centric, limiting its applicability in geoscience. Many geoscientific tasks are inherently evidence-hungry. Typical examples involve imputing missing observations using analog scenes, retrieving equations and parameters to calibrate models, geolocating field photos based on visual cues, or surfacing historical case studies to support policy analyses. A simple ``retrieve-then-generate'' pipeline is insufficient for these needs. We envision Geo-RAG, a next-generation paradigm that reimagines RAG as a modular retrieve $\rightarrow$ reason $\rightarrow$ generate $\rightarrow$ verify loop. Geo-RAG supports four core capabilities: (i) retrieval of multi-modal Earth data; (ii) reasoning under physical and domain constraints; (iii) generation of science-grade artifacts; and (iv) verification of generated hypotheses against numerical models, ground measurements, and expert assessments. This shift opens new opportunities for more trustworthy and transparent geoscience workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoRSMLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Vision-Language Tasks in Geoscience and Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12490v1)** | 2025-03-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12490v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  |

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accpe...</summary><p>accpeted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> |

In this work, we discuss a series of developments in the field of prototype-based XAI that show potential for scientific learning tasks, with a focus on the geosciences. We organize the prototype-based XAI literature into three themes: the development and visualization of prototypes, types of prototypes, and the use of prototypes in various learning tasks. We discuss how the authors use prototype-based methods, their novel contributions, and any limitations or challenges that may arise when adapting these methods for geoscientific learning tasks. We highlight differences between geoscientific data sets and the standard benchmarks used to develop XAI methods, and discuss how specific geoscientific applications may benefit from using or modifying existing prototype-based XAI techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI for Science Workshop-Oral (Attention Track), Proceedings of 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Geoscience Artificial Intelligence (XGeoS-AI): Application to Demystify Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04940v2)** | 2024-05-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.04940v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth science enters the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) not only offers great potential for solving geoscience problems, but also plays a critical role in accelerating the understanding of the complex, interactive, and multiscale processes of Earth's behavior. As geoscience AI models are progressively utilized for significant predictions in crucial situations, geoscience researchers are increasingly demanding their interpretability and versatility. This study proposes an interpretable geoscience artificial intelligence (XGeoS-AI) framework to unravel the mystery of image recognition in the Earth sciences, and its effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated by taking computed tomography (CT) image recognition as an example. Inspired by the mechanism of human vision, the proposed XGeoS-AI framework generates a threshold value from a local region within the whole image to complete the recognition. Different kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can be adopted as the AI engines of the proposed XGeoS-AI framework to efficiently complete geoscience image recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness, versatility, and heuristics of the proposed framework have great potential in solving geoscience image recognition problems. Interpretable AI should receive more and more attention in the field of the Earth sciences, which is the key to promoting more rational and wider applications of AI in the field of Earth sciences. In addition, the proposed interpretable framework may be the forerunner of technological innovation in the Earth sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some erros in the results, and a newer revision is still preparing</p></details> |
| **[GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00434v2)** | 2024-04-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2401.00434v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success for their general knowledge and ability to solve a wide spectrum of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically, GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens, preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica, including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training, SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.</p></details> |  |

The underlying idea of our approach for selecting knots is to apply the generalized lasso, since the knots of the B-spline basis can be seen as changes in the derivatives of the function to be estimated. This method was then extended to functions depending on several variables by processing each dimension independently, thus reducing the problem to a univariate setting. The regularization parameters were chosen by means of a criterion based on EBIC. The nonparametric estimator was obtained using a multivariate B-spline regression with the corresponding selected knots. Our procedure was validated through numerical experiments by varying the number of observations and the level of noise to investigate its robustness. The influence of observation sampling was also assessed and our method was applied to a chemical system commonly used in geoscience. For each different framework considered in this paper, our approach performed better than state-of-the-art methods. Our completely data-driven method is implemented in the glober R package which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</p></details> | 29 pages, 27 figures |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Generative AI and Large Language Models: Foundations, Trends, and Future Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03349v1)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.03349v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) represents an emerging field that promises the creation of synthetic data and outputs in different modalities. GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models that have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks (GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience community in several applications, including (but not limited to) data generation/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze removal, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain such as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and trustworthiness. Beyond that, GAI models show promises to the geoscience community, especially with the support to climate change, urban science, atmospheric science, marine science, and planetary science through their extraordinary ability to data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable modeling to unify machine learning and physical models and advance Geosciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04027v2)** | 2023-12-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2301.04027v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-Based Modeling (PBM) and Machine Learning (ML) are often perceived as distinct paradigms in the geosciences. Here we present differentiable geoscientific modeling as a powerful pathway toward dissolving the perceived barrier between them and ushering in a paradigm shift. For decades, PBM offered benefits in interpretability and physical consistency but struggled to efficiently leverage large datasets. ML methods, especially deep networks, presented strong predictive skills yet lacked the ability to answer specific scientific questions. While various methods have been proposed for ML-physics integration, an important underlying theme -- differentiable modeling -- is not sufficiently recognized. Here we outline the concepts, applicability, and significance of differentiable geoscientific modeling (DG). "Differentiable" refers to accurately and efficiently calculating gradients with respect to model variables, critically enabling the learning of high-dimensional unknown relationships. DG refers to a range of methods connecting varying amounts of prior knowledge to neural networks and training them together, capturing a different scope than physics-guided machine learning and emphasizing first principles. Preliminary evidence suggests DG offers better interpretability and causality than ML, improved generalizability and extrapolation capability, and strong potential for knowledge discovery, while approaching the performance of purely data-driven ML. DG models require less training data while scaling favorably in performance and efficiency with increasing amounts of data. With DG, geoscientists may be better able to frame and investigate questions, test hypotheses, and discover unrecognized linkages.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model. Moreover, we share a protocol that can efficiently gather domain-specific data and construct domain-supervised data, even in situations where manpower is scarce. Meanwhile, we equip K2 with the abilities of using tools to be a naive geoscience aide. Experiments conducted on the GeoBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and datasets on geoscience knowledge understanding and utilization.We open-source all the training data and K2 model checkpoints at https://github.com/davendw49/k2.</p></details> |  |

AI algorithms, especially deep learning-based ones, have been developed and applied widely to RS data analysis. The successful application of AI covers almost all aspects of Earth observation (EO) missions, from low-level vision tasks like super-resolution, denoising and inpainting, to high-level vision tasks like scene classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. While AI techniques enable researchers to observe and understand the Earth more accurately, the vulnerability and uncertainty of AI models deserve further attention, considering that many geoscience and RS tasks are highly safety-critical. This paper reviews the current development of AI security in the geoscience and RS field, covering the following five important aspects: adversarial attack, backdoor attack, federated learning, uncertainty and explainability. Moreover, the potential opportunities and trends are discussed to provide insights for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to provide a systematic review of AI security-related research in the geoscience and RS community. Available code and datasets are also listed in the paper to move this vibrant field of research forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coarse-to-fine Task-driven Inpainting for Geoscience Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11059v3)** | 2022-12-06 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2211.11059v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The processing and recognition of geoscience images have wide applications. Most of existing researches focus on understanding the high-quality geoscience images by assuming that all the images are clear. However, in many real-world cases, the geoscience images might contain occlusions during the image acquisition. This problem actually implies the image inpainting problem in computer vision and multimedia. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing image inpainting algorithms learn to repair the occluded regions for a better visualization quality, they are excellent for natural images but not good enough for geoscience images by ignoring the geoscience related tasks. This paper aims to repair the occluded regions for a better geoscience task performance with the advanced visualization quality simultaneously, without changing the current deployed deep learning based geoscience models. Because of the complex context of geoscience images, we propose a coarse-to-fine encoder-decoder network with coarse-to-fine adversarial context discriminators to reconstruct the occluded image regions. Due to the limited data of geoscience images, we use a MaskMix based data augmentation method to exploit more information from limited geoscience image data. The experimental results on three public geoscience datasets for remote sensing scene recognition, cross-view geolocation and semantic segmentation tasks respectively show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.</p></details> |  |

However, the predominant reliance on visual encoding of data continues to create accessibility barriers for people who are blind/vision impaired resulting in their under representation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This research study seeks to understand the experiences of professionals who are blind/vision impaired in one such STEM discipline (geosciences) in accessing data visualizations. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven professionals were conducted to examine the accessibility barriers and areas for improvement to inform accessibility research pertaining to data visualizations through a socio-technical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of visualizations in influencing their career path, lack of data exploration tools for research, barriers in accessing works of peers and mismatched pace of visualization and accessibility research. The article also includes recommendations from the participants to address some of these accessibility barriers.</p></details> |  |

Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated preprint version of the manuscript.

Quantifying complexity and non-stationarity of these data is a challenging task, and advanced complexity-based exploratory tool are required for understanding and visualizing such data. This paper discusses the Fisher-Shannon method, from which one can obtain a complexity measure and detect non-stationarity, as an efficient data exploration tool. The state-of-the-art studies related to the Fisher-Shannon measures are collected, and new analytical formulas for positive unimodal skewed distributions are proposed. Case studies on both synthetic and real data illustrate the usefulness of the Fisher-Shannon method, which can find application in different domains including time series discrimination and generation of times series features for clustering, modeling and forecasting. The paper is accompanied with Python and R libraries for the non-parametric estimation of the proposed measures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference, thus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions, and 2) the estimation of {\em statistical independence} between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the {\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.</p></details> |  |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex and elusive interactions between processes. In this paper we explore a framework to derive cause-effect relations from pairs of variables via regression and dependence estimation. We propose to focus on the sensitivity (curvature) of the dependence estimator to account for the asymmetry of the forward and inverse densities of approximation residuals. Results in a large collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems demonstrate the good capabilities of the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1611.00555, arXiv:2012.05150</p></details> |

A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope. In general, I aim to provide context for the recent enthusiasm surrounding deep learning with respect to research, hardware, and software developments that enable successful application of shallow and deep machine learning in all disciplines of Earth science.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 17 figures, book chapter</p></details> |

As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The second version of this manuscript is currently under review at the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)</p></details> |

Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media, memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming "enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression techniques.</p></details> |  |

They have been applied in numerous science areas, but their application to the geosciences has been limited due to their inefficiency in high-dimensional systems in standard settings. However, huge progress has been made, and this limitation is disappearing fast due to recent developments in proposal densities, the use of ideas from (optimal) transportation, the use of localisation and intelligent adaptive resampling strategies. Furthermore, powerful hybrids between particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods have been developed. We present a state of the art discussion of present efforts of developing particle filters for highly nonlinear geoscience state-estimation problems with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic applications, including many new ideas, derivations, and unifications, highlighting hidden connections, and generating a valuable tool and guide for the community. Initial experiments show that particle filters can be competitive with present-day methods for numerical weather prediction suggesting that they will become mainstream soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Review paper, 36 pages, 9 figures, Resubmitted to Q.J.Royal Meteorol.

A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is easy to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the corresponding exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated log-normal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a truncated power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated log-normals, although wildfires also may show power-law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to the analyzed data sets, but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in the future.</p></details> |  |

This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. Data assimilation is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of data assimilation, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of data assimilation being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of data assimilation and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 10 figures, Invited review</p></details> |

As geosciences enters the era of big data, machine learning (ML) -- that has been widely successful in commercial domains -- offers immense potential to contribute to problems in geosciences.

This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it challenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions for methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing some of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable across all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</p></details> |

However, their computational cost increases rapidly with the number of locations, potentially needing multiple hours even for moderate sample sizes. To address this, we propose using Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (SIVI), a highly flexible Bayesian approximation method, for scalable Bayesian spatial interpolation. We evaluated SIVI with a GP prior and a Nearest-Neighbour Gaussian Process (NNGP) prior compared to Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI), Pathfinder, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), the reference method in spatial statistics. Methods were compared based on their predictive ability measured by the CRPS, the interval score, and the negative log-predictive density across 50 replicates for both Gaussian and Poisson outcomes. SIVI-based methods achieved similar results to HMC, while being drastically faster. On average, for the Poisson scenario with 500 training locations, SIVI reduced the computational time from roughly 6 hours for HMC to 130 seconds. Furthermore, SIVI-NNGP analyzed a simulated land surface temperature dataset of 150,000 locations while estimating all unknown model parameters in under two minutes. These results highlight the potential of SIVI as a flexible and scalable inference technique in spatial statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

More precisely, we consider a family of pre-trained convolutional filters and estimate deeply parametrized spatially varying parameters applied to the sparse feature maps by means of unrolling a FISTA algorithm to solve the underlying sparse estimation problem. The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the EUSIPCO 2025 conference; corrected typo in equation (3)</p></details> |

They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/MV-RoboBench</p></details> |

However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |

However, such spatial sparsity of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026 Conference Submission</p></details> |

This class of technologies has enabled the investigation of the spatial variation of gene expressions and their impact on specific biological processes. Identifying genes with similar expression profiles is of utmost importance, thus motivating the development of flexible methods leveraging spatial data structure to cluster genes. Here, we propose a modeling framework for clustering observations measured over numerous spatial locations via Gaussian processes. Rather than specifying their covariance kernels as a function of the spatial structure, we use it to inform a generalized Cholesky decomposition of their precision matrices. This approach prevents issues with kernel misspecification and facilitates the estimation of a non-stationarity spatial covariance structure. Applied to spatial transcriptomic data, our model identifies gene clusters with distinctive spatial correlation patterns across tissue areas comprising different cell types, like tumoral and stromal areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in Journal of Classification</p></details> |

Although vision-language models (VLMs) and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models' reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with dynamic spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, representations within most machine learning models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs. We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the organization of linguistic information in the human brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Workshop on Representational Alignment (Re-Align) Camera Ready</p></details> |

While KV cache compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware.</p></details> |  |

When managing such data, spatial database systems offer various index options and data formats, e.g., point-based or trajectory-based. Likewise, dataset characteristics such as geographic overlap and skew can vary significantly. All three significantly affect database performance. While this has been studied in existing papers, none of them explore the effects and trade-offs resulting from a combination of all three aspects. In this paper, we evaluate the performance impact of index choice, data format, and dataset characteristics on a popular spatial database system, PostGIS. We focus on two aspects of dataset characteristics, the degree of overlap and the degree of skew, and propose novel approximation methods to determine these features. We design a benchmark that compares a variety of spatial indexing strategies and data formats, while also considering the impact of dataset characteristics on database performance. We include a variety of real-world and synthetic datasets, write operations, and read queries to cover a broad range of scenarios that might occur during application runtime.

Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at https://github.com/zhangquanchen/3DThinker.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, automatic traffic detectors across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals, providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima. Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.</p></details> |  |

To capture this complexity and account for spatial dependencies across small areas, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates non-linear functions with the Besag, York, and Mollie (BYM2) model. Applying this framework to all-cause mortality data in Switzerland, we quantified spatial inequalities in heat-related mortality. We retrieved daily all-cause mortality at small areas (2,145 municipalities) for people older than 65 years from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and daily mean temperature at 1km$\times$1km grid from the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology. By fully propagating uncertainties, we derived key epidemiological metrics, including heat-related excess mortality and minimum mortality temperature (MMT). Heat-related excess mortality rates were higher in northern Switzerland, while lower MMTs were observed in mountainous regions. Further, we explored the role of the proportion of individuals older than 85 years, green space, average temperature, deprivation, urbanicity, air pollution, and language regions in explaining these discrepancies. We found that spatial disparities in heat-related excess mortality were primarily driven by population age distribution, green space, and vulnerabilities associated with elevated temperature exposure.</p></details> |  |

A key ingredient of our approach is utilizing the asymptotic behavior of the periodogram. For second-order stationary point processes, the periodogram is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the spectrum. By calculating the moment, we show that under inhomogeneity, the expectation of the periodogram converges to a matrix-valued function, which we refer to as the pseudo-spectrum. The pseudo-spectrum shares similar properties with the spectrum of stationary processes and admits interpretation in terms of local parameters. We derive a consistent nonparametric estimator of the pseudo-spectrum via kernel smoothing and propose two bandwidth selection methods. The performance and utility of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulation studies and an application to rainforest point pattern data.</p></details> |  |

Layer Toggling mitigates visual overload by organizing information into separate layers while enabling comparisons through controlled overlays. This technique supports focused analysis without losing spatial context and allows users to switch layers using a dedicated button. Visibility-Preserving Lenses adapt their size and transparency dynamically, enabling detailed inspection of dense spatial regions and temporal attributes. These techniques facilitate urban data exploration and improve prediction. Understanding complex phenomena related to crime, mobility, and residents' behavior is crucial for informed urban planning. Yet navigating such data often causes cognitive overload and visual clutter due to overlapping layers. We validate our visualization tool through a user study measuring performance, cognitive load, and interaction efficiency. Using real-world data from Sao Paulo, we demonstrate how our approach enhances exploratory and analytical tasks and provides guidelines for future interactive systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Rather than discrete treatment parameters, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as continuous functions $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous analysis of boundary evolution, spatial gradients, and cumulative exposure. Empirical validation using 32,520 U.S. ZIP codes demonstrates exponential spatial decay for healthcare access ($\kappa = 0.002837$ per km, $R^2 = 0.0129$) with detectable boundaries at 37.1 km. The framework successfully diagnoses when scope conditions hold: positive decay parameters validate diffusion assumptions near hospitals, while negative parameters correctly signal urban confounding effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals 2-13 $\times$ stronger distance effects for elderly populations and substantial education gradients. Model selection strongly favors logarithmic decay over exponential ($\Delta \text{AIC} > 10,000$), representing a middle ground between exponential and power-law decay. Applications span environmental economics, banking, and healthcare policy. The continuous functional framework provides predictive capability ($d^*(t) = \xi^* \sqrt{t}$), parameter sensitivity ($\partial d^*/\partial \nu$), and diagnostic tests unavailable in traditional difference-in-differences approaches.</p></details> | 68 pages, 10 figures |

Rather than discrete treatment effect estimators, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as a continuous function $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous analysis of propagation dynamics, boundary evolution, and cumulative exposure patterns. Building on exact self-similar solutions expressible through Kummer confluent hypergeometric and modified Bessel functions, I establish that treatment effects follow scaling laws $\tau(d, t) = t^{-\alpha} f(d/t^\beta)$ where exponents characterize diffusion mechanisms. Empirical validation using 42 million TROPOMI satellite observations of NO$_2$ pollution from U.S. coal-fired power plants demonstrates strong exponential spatial decay ($\kappa_s = 0.004$ per km, $R^2 = 0.35$) with detectable boundaries at 572 km. Monte Carlo simulations confirm superior performance over discrete parametric methods in boundary detection and false positive avoidance (94\% vs 27\% correct rejection). Regional heterogeneity analysis validates diagnostic capability: positive decay parameters within 100 km confirm coal plant dominance; negative parameters beyond 100 km correctly signal when urban sources dominate. The continuous functional perspective unifies spatial econometrics with mathematical physics, providing theoretically grounded methods for boundary detection, exposure quantification, and policy evaluation across environmental economics, banking, and healthcare applications.</p></details> | 79 pages, 5 figures |

The method employs local linear regression with data-driven bandwidth selection to flexibly estimate spatial decay patterns and detect treatment effect boundaries. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the nonparametric approach exhibits lower bias and correctly identifies the absence of boundaries when none exist, unlike parametric methods that may impose spurious spatial patterns. I apply this framework to bank branch openings during 2015--2020, matching 5,743 new branches to 5.9 million mortgage applications across 14,209 census tracts. The analysis reveals that branch proximity significantly affects loan application volume (8.5\% decline per 10 miles) but not approval rates, consistent with branches stimulating demand through local presence while credit decisions remain centralized. Examining branch survival during the digital transformation era (2010--2023), I find a non-monotonic relationship with area income: high-income areas experience more closures despite conventional wisdom. This counterintuitive pattern reflects strategic consolidation of redundant branches in over-banked wealthy urban areas rather than discrimination against poor neighborhoods. Controlling for branch density, urbanization, and competition, the direct income effect diminishes substantially, with branch density emerging as the primary determinant of survival. These findings demonstrate the necessity of flexible nonparametric methods for detecting complex spatial patterns that parametric models would miss, and challenge simplistic narratives about banking deserts by revealing the organizational complexity underlying spatial consolidation decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://falcon-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth, edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments. Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality in spatial perception tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025). 8 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

However, creating engaging VR presentations remains a challenging and time-consuming task for users, hindering the full realization of VR presentation's capabilities. This research aims to explore the potential of VR presentation, analyze users' opinions, and investigate these via providing a user-friendly no-coding authoring tool. Through an examination of popular presentation software and interviews with seven professionals, we identified five design aspects and four design challenges for VR presentations. Based on the findings, we developed VRStory, a prototype for presentation authoring without coding to explore the design aspects and strategies for addressing the challenges. VRStory offers a variety of predefined and customizable VR elements, as well as modules for layout design, navigation control, and asset generation. A user study was then conducted with 12 participants to investigate their opinions and authoring experience with VRStory. Our results demonstrated that, while acknowledging the advantages of immersive and spatial features in VR, users often have a consistent mental model for traditional 2D presentations and may still prefer planar and static formats in VR for better accessibility and efficient communication. We finally shared our learned design considerations for future development of VR presentation tools, emphasizing the importance of balancing of promoting immersive features and ensuring accessibility.</p></details> |  |

Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024) demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This Work has been submitted to Monthly Weather Review.

We identify two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set (MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of 3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of high-quality training data for future models.

As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment method, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through complex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high- resolution local traversability map. Then, we design a spatial- temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores, integrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied in the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate that our method outper- forms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop an autonomous navigation framework integrated with the traversability map and validate it with a differential driven vehicle in complex outdoor envi- ronments. Our code will be open-source for further research and development by the community, https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK.</p></details> | accepted by IROS2025 |

However, such zero-shot object navigation is typically designed for simple queries with an object name like "television" or "blue rug". Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial relationships, such as "find the remote on the table" while still leveraging robustness of a semantic map. We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i) Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original, complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial search queries to more effectively guide the search process. We validate our system through extensive experiments on the MultiON benchmark and real-world deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot using a Jetson Orin AGX.

However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

The proposed model incorporates spatial autocorrelation through a spatially lagged response and characterizes the entire conditional distribution of a scalar outcome given a functional predictor. To address the endogeneity induced by the spatial lag term, we develop two robust estimation procedures based on instrumental variable strategies. $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are established under mild regularity conditions. We demonstrate through extensive Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed estimators outperform existing mean-based and robust alternatives, particularly in settings with strong spatial dependence and outlier contamination. We apply our method to high-resolution environmental data from the Lombardy region in Italy, using daily ozone trajectories to predict daily mean particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers concentrations. The empirical results confirm the superiority of our approach in predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability across various quantile levels.

Specifically, we assume for each instance a random location. Then, conditional on this random location, we assume for the feature vector a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The proposed SGMM allows the mixing probability to be nonparametrically related to the spatial location. Compared with a classical GMM, SGMM is considerably more flexible and allows the instances from the same class to be spatially clustered. To estimate the SGMM, novel EM algorithms are developed and rigorous asymptotic theories are established. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate our finite sample performance. For a real application, we apply our SGMM method to the CAMELYON16 dataset of whole-slide images (WSIs) for breast cancer detection. The SGMM method demonstrates outstanding clustering performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views, S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and 4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional analog or digital beamforming arrays, SHAs enable concurrent multi-beamforming without requiring substantial hardware replication. SHAs replace the need for hardware replication with frequency-domain multiplexing. Furthermore, SHAs have the potential to become key contributors to future 6G networks by enabling scalable multi-user communications, joint communication and sensing, and spatial interference mitigation. In addition, an analysis of the SHA's harmonic-modulation waveform and its effects on gain, noise and bandwidth is presented. A comb-like modulation waveform for SHAs that minimizes spectral inefficiency is proposed. Further, an analysis of the SHA's capability to independently steer multiple beams is presented.

Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/gaslight/</p></details> |  |

It provides spatially resolved gene expression data but often lacks cellular resolution, necessitating cell type deconvolution to infer cellular composition at each spatial location. In this paper we propose BASIN for cell type deconvolution, which models deconvolution as a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem incorporating graph Laplacian prior. Rather than find a deterministic optima like other recent methods, we propose a matrix variate Bayesian NMF method with nonnegativity and sparsity priors, in which the variables are maintained in their matrix form to derive a more efficient matrix normal posterior. BASIN employs a Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of cell type proportions and other parameters, offering a distribution of possible solutions, enhancing robustness and providing inherent uncertainty quantification. The performance of BASIN is evaluated on different spatial transcriptomics datasets and outperforms other deconvolution methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the effect of the incorporated priors and reflect a truncated matrix normal distribution as we expect.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |

Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.</p></details> |  |

However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |

Our approach involves converting spatial data into one-dimensional time series using space-filling Hilbert curves. We then apply ordinal pattern-based tests for serial dependence to this series. Because Hilbert curves preserve spatial locality, spatial dependence in the original field manifests as serial dependence in the transformed sequence. The approach is easy to implement, accommodates arbitrary grid sizes through generalized Hilbert (``gilbert'') curves, and naturally extends beyond three dimensions. This provides a practical and general alternative to existing methods based on spatial ordinal patterns, which are typically limited to two-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |

Despite the critical role of spatial audio in immersive technologies such as VR/AR, most existing multimodal datasets provide only monaural audio, which limits the development of spatial audio generation and understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce MRSAudio, a large-scale multimodal spatial audio dataset designed to advance research in spatial audio understanding and generation. MRSAudio spans four distinct components: MRSLife, MRSSpeech, MRSMusic, and MRSSing, covering diverse real-world scenarios. The dataset includes synchronized binaural and ambisonic audio, exocentric and egocentric video, motion trajectories, and fine-grained annotations such as transcripts, phoneme boundaries, lyrics, scores, and prompts. To demonstrate the utility and versatility of MRSAudio, we establish five foundational tasks: audio spatialization, and spatial text to speech, spatial singing voice synthesis, spatial music generation and sound event localization and detection. Results show that MRSAudio enables high-quality spatial modeling and supports a broad range of spatial audio research.

Under uncertain and correlated network demand, the service operator periodically repositions vehicles to match a fixed supply with spatial customer demand while minimizing costs. Finding an optimal repositioning policy in such a general inventory network is analytically and computationally challenging. We introduce a base-stock repositioning policy as a multidimensional generalization of the classical inventory rule to $n$ locations, and we establish its asymptotic optimality under two practically relevant regimes. We present exact reformulations that enable efficient computation of the best base-stock policy in an offline setting with historical data. In the online setting, we illustrate the challenges of learning with censored data in networked systems through a regret lower bound analysis and by demonstrating the suboptimality of alternative algorithmic approaches. We propose a Surrogate Optimization and Adaptive Repositioning algorithm and prove that it attains an optimal regret of $O(n^{2.5} \sqrt{T})$, which matches the regret lower bound in $T$ with polynomial dependence on $n$. Our work highlights the critical role of inventory repositioning in the viability of shared mobility businesses and illuminates the inherent challenges posed by data and network complexity. Our results demonstrate that simple, interpretable policies, such as the state-independent base-stock policies we analyze, can provide significant practical value and achieve near-optimal performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper split: part of v1 (mainly Appendix F) is now superseded by another standalone paper</p></details> |

However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on 2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of depth estimators. We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial representations that enhance action precision. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/</p></details> |  |

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

We identify a key limitation: while tactile sensors provide rich contact information, current learning frameworks fail to effectively leverage both the perceptual richness of tactile signals and their spatial relationship with hand kinematics. We believe an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact measurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory information, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an end-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric reasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key insight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous manipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task demanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb installation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and card sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision. These tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to their stringent precision requirements. Across multiple benchmarks, SaTA significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines, improving success rates by up to 30 percentage while reducing task completion times by 27 percentage.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with minimal overhead in training.

The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation (SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods.

This paper proposes a novel model-free approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.</p></details> |  |

We use differential evolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals independently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic surveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information gain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We simulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning pre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing capability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed within the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and frequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are driven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with failures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of the map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their higher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75% compared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from 1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional sensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges. These results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic phenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the environment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through optimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design consideration for effective robotic surveillance.</p></details> |  |

Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training. UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability across diverse data availability scenarios.

| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of Dengue in Recife, Brazil (2015-2024): The Role of Spatial Granularity and Data Quality for Epidemiological Risk Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13672v1)** | 2025-10-15 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.13672v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dengue remains one of Brazil's major epidemiological challenges, marked by strong intra-urban inequalities and the influence of climatic and socio-environmental factors. This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal component. Covariates included population density, household size, income, drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817; WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019. Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for decision-making in urban health management.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose RoboMAP, a framework that represents spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps. This dense representation captures the uncertainty in spatial grounding and provides richer information for downstream policies, thereby significantly enhancing task success and interpretability. RoboMAP surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on a majority of grounding benchmarks with up to a 50x speed improvement, and achieves an 82\% success rate in real-world manipulation. Across extensive simulated and physical experiments, it demonstrates robust performance and shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation.

| **[Spatial-DISE: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13394v1)** | 2025-10-15 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.13394v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, \textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants: \textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic, \textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover, to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions, resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence, especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs. 93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

However, with modern technology, it is common to observe vector-valued mixed-type responses, e.g., a combination of binary, count, or continuous types, at each location. Methods that allow joint modeling of such mixed-type multivariate spatial responses are rare. Using latent multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs), we present a class of Bayesian spatial methods that can be employed for any combination of exponential family responses. Since multivariate GP-based methods can suffer from computational bottlenecks when the number of spatial locations is high, we further employ a computationally efficient Vecchia approximation for fast posterior inference and prediction. Key theoretical properties of the proposed model, such as identifiability and the structure of the induced covariance, are established. Our approach employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference method that utilizes elliptical slice sampling in a blocked Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling framework. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through simulation studies and a real-data application on joint modeling of wildfire counts and burnt areas across the United States.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We introduce T(R,O) Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph, a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly, the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation, underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for dexterous grasping.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

This paper revisits the $\alpha$--regression framework, which uses a flexible power transformation parameterized by $\alpha$ to interpolate between raw data analysis and log-ratio methods, naturally handling zeros without imputation while allowing data-driven transformation selection. We formulate $\alpha$--regression as a non-linear least squares problem, provide efficient estimation via the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with explicit gradient and Hessian derivations, establish asymptotic normality of the estimators, and derive marginal effects for interpretation. The framework is extended to spatial settings through two models: the $\alpha$--spatially lagged X regression model, which incorporates spatial spillover effects via spatially lagged covariates with decomposition into direct and indirect effects, and the geographically weighted $\alpha$--regression, which allows coefficients to vary spatially for capturing local relationships. Application to Greek agricultural land-use data demonstrates that spatial extensions substantially improve predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[AngularFuse: A Closer Look at Angle-based Perception for Spatial-Sensitive Multi-Modality Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12260v1)** | 2025-10-14 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.12260v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the first time, angle-based perception was introduced into the multi-modality image fusion task</p></details> |
| **[GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683v2)** | 2025-10-14 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.19683v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by enhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the absolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance task learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained grasp pose feature extractors.

Following the idea of the convolution approach, the diffusion-wave model is first transformed into an equivalent formulation. A fully discrete scheme is then developed by applying a compact difference approximation in space and combining the averaged product integration rule with linear interpolation quadrature in time. An efficient high-order two-grid algorithm is constructed by solving a small-scale nonlinear system on the coarse grid and a large-scale linearized system on the fine grid, where the bicubic spline interpolation operator is used to project coarse-grid solutions to the fine grid. Under mild assumptions on the variable exponent $\alpha(t)$, the stability and convergence of the STG compact difference scheme are rigorously established. Numerical experiments are finally presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional prototype-based methods rely on deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization. This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics, and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IVCNZ 2025.

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Existing models often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted at ICCV Conference 2025</p></details> |

Deep learning achieved SOTA performance on stained, high-contrast images but needs large labeled datasets, expensive hardware, and fails under uneven illumination. This study presents a low-cost, lightweight, annotation-free segmentation method by introducing one-time calibration-assisted unsupervised framework adaptable across imaging modalities and image type. The framework determines background via spatial standard deviation from the local mean. Uncertain pixels are resolved using fuzzy logic, cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity, statistical features, followed by post-segmentation denoising calibration which is saved as a profile for reuse until noise pattern or object type substantially change. The program runs as a script or graphical interface for non-programmers. The method was rigorously evaluated using \textit{IoU}, \textit{F1-score}, and other metrics, with statistical significance confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. On unstained brightfield myoblast (C2C12) images, it outperformed \textit{Cellpose 3.0} and \textit{StarDist}, improving IoU by up to 48\% (average IoU = 0.43, F1 = 0.60). In phase-contrast microscopy, it achieved a mean IoU of 0.69 and an F1-score of 0.81 on the \textit{LIVECell} dataset ($n = 3178$), with substantial expert agreement ($\kappa > 0.75$) confirming cross-modality robustness. Successful segmentation of laser-affected polymer surfaces further confirmed cross-domain robustness. By introducing the \textit{Homogeneous Image Plane} concept, this work provides a new theoretical foundation for training-free, annotation-free segmentation. The framework operates efficiently on CPU, avoids cell staining, and is practical for live-cell imaging and biomedical applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts. CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization, refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a logic, called neighborhood operator logic with acyclicity, connectivity and clique constraints ($\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ for short), that captures all NP-hard problems$\unicode{x2013}$like Independent Set or Hamiltonian Cycle$\unicode{x2013}$that are known to be tractable in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ and space $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ on $n$-vertex graphs provided with elimination forests of depth $k$. We provide a model checking algorithm for $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ with such complexity that unifies and extends these results. For $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{k}$, the fragment of the above logic that does not use acyclicity and connectivity constraints, we get a strengthening of this result, where the space complexity is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(k\log(n))$. With a similar mechanism as the distance neighborhood logic introduced in [Bergougnoux, Dreier and Jaffke, SODA 2023], the logic $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ is an extension of the fully-existential $\mathsf{MSO}_2$ with predicates for (1) querying generalizations of the neighborhoods of vertex sets, (2) verifying the connectivity and acyclicity of vertex and edge sets, and (3) verifying that a vertex set induces a clique. Our results provide $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time and $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ space algorithms for problems for which the existence of such algorithms was previously unknown. In particular, $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]$ captures CNF-SAT via the incidence graphs associated to CNF formulas, and it also captures several modulo counting problems like Odd Dominating Set.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SODA 2026</p></details> |

This challenge is exacerbated with time-series data, which also exhibit inherent nonstationarity--variations in statistical and spectral properties over time. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on learning generalizable representations for time-series classification by considering the phase information of a signal as an approximate proxy for nonstationarity and propose a phase-driven generalizable representation learning framework for time-series classification, PhASER. It consists of three key elements: 1) Hilbert transform-based augmentation, which diversifies nonstationarity while preserving task-specific discriminatory semantics, 2) separate magnitude-phase encoding, viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) phase-residual feature broadcasting, integrating 2D phase features with a residual connection to the 1D signal representation, providing inherent regularization to improve distribution-invariant learning. Extensive evaluations on five datasets from sleep-stage classification, human activity recognition, and gesture recognition against 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 11% in some cases. Additionally, the principles of PhASER can be broadly applied to enhance the generalizability of existing time-series representation learning models.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |

In robotics, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages and appendix |

Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.</p></details> |  |

Despite impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting. Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains. Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods.

However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination, yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 20 figures, under review</p></details> |

Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size. As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found a fundamental error (data leakage) in cross-validation setup affecting both papers.

These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video generation.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences, which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO) meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones, we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.</p></details> |  |

However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, and show that flexible and general models of computation are efficiently learnable.</p></details> |  |

We theoretically show in finite samples that depending on the permitted sampling information, the RV estimator is most efficient under either hitting time sampling that samples whenever the price changes by a pre-determined threshold, or under the new concept of realized business time that samples according to a combination of observed trades and estimated tick variance. The analysis builds on the assumption that asset prices follow a diffusion that is time-changed with a jump process that separately models the transaction times. This provides a flexible model that allows for leverage specifications and Hawkes-type jump processes and separately captures the empirically varying trading intensity and tick variance processes, which are particularly relevant for disentangling the driving forces of the sampling schemes. Extensive simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that for low levels of noise, hitting time sampling remains superior while for increasing noise levels, realized business time becomes the empirically most efficient sampling scheme. An application to stock data provides empirical evidence for the benefits of using these intrinsic sampling schemes to construct more efficient RV estimators as well as for an improved forecast performance.</p></details> |  |

However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios. Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The approach deals with adjoint-based Lagrangian methodology, which enables efficient gradient computation and systematic derivation of optimality conditions for both distributed and concentrated control formulations. The proposed framework is first verified using a time-dependent advection-diffusion problem endowed with a manufactured solution to assess accuracy and convergence properties. Subsequently, two representative applications involving drug delivery are investigated: (i) a light-triggered drug delivery system for targeted cancer therapy and (ii) a catheter-based drug delivery system in a patient-specific coronary artery. Numerical experiments not only demonstrate the accuracy of the approach, but also its flexibility and robustness in handling complex geometries, heterogeneous parameters, and realistic boundary conditions, highlighting its potential for the optimal design and control of complex biomedical systems.</p></details> |  |

This problem is fundamental to swarm robotics applications like self-reconfiguration and marching, where standard MAPF is insufficient as it does not guarantee the required connectivity between agents. While unlabeled MAPF is tractable in optimization, CUMAPF is NP-hard even on highly restricted graph classes. To tackle this challenge, we propose PULL, a complete and polynomial-time algorithm with a simple design. It is based on a rule-based one-step function that computes a subsequent configuration that preserves connectivity and advances towards the target configuration. PULL is lightweight, and runs in $O(n^2)$ time per step in 2D grid, where $n$ is the number of agents. Our experiments further demonstrate its practical performance: PULL finds competitive solution qualities against trivial solutions for hundreds of agents, in randomly generated instances. Furthermore, we develop an eventually optimal solver that integrates PULL into an existing search-based MAPF algorithm, providing a valuable tool for small-scale instances.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space. These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while being computationally efficient.

Addressing the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining 81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection (13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, its accuracy has previously been supported only by numerical evidence, lacking rigorous theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the first explicit error bound for the truncation error of the Koopman-Hill projection method, establishing a solid theoretical foundation for its application. The bound applies to linear time-periodic systems whose Fourier coefficients decay exponentially with a sufficient rate, and is derived using constructive series expansions. The bound quantifies the difference between the true and approximated fundamental solution matrices, clarifies conditions for guaranteed convergence, and enables conservative but reliable inference of Floquet multipliers and stability properties. Additionally, the same methodology applied to a subharmonic formulation demonstrates improved convergence rates of the latter. Numerical examples, including the Mathieu equation and the Duffing oscillator, illustrate the practical relevance of the bound and underscore its importance as the first rigorous theoretical justification for the Koopman-Hill projection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, 39 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in data space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in data space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the temporal-feature data space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series while preserving robust watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against five datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the strongest state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules - a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define human-readable intervals that indicate where and when decision-relevant segments occur and can enhance model transparency by localizing threshold-based conditions on the raw series. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations - a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon - into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR may improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks by providing concise, human-readable rules aligned with model predictions.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we propose MINED, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness, understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07, while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile, LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is weakest on sport.

This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel. By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals. We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |

Traditional approaches, such as frequency analysis or machine learning, often overlook subtle characteristics of sound. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can capture complex patterns, but its application to timbre has been limited, partly because it is unclear how to represent sound effectively for TDA. In this study, we investigate how different time delay embeddings affect TDA results. Using both synthetic and real audio signals, we identify time delays that enhance the detection of harmonic structures. Our findings show that specific delays, related to fractions of the fundamental period, allow TDA to reveal key harmonic features and distinguish between integer and non-integer harmonics. The method is effective for synthetic and real musical instrument sounds and opens the way for future works, which could extend it to more complex sounds using higher-dimensional embeddings and additional persistence statistics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face two critical challenges: parameter interference among tasks, which leads to catastrophic forgetting, and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions. To address these issues, we introduce the task of Test-Time Continual Model Merging (TTCMM), which leverages a small set of unlabeled test samples during inference to alleviate parameter conflicts and handle distribution shifts. We propose MINGLE, a novel framework for TTCMM. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture with parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, which enhances adaptability to evolving test distributions while dynamically merging models to mitigate conflicts. To further reduce forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations, thereby suppressing activations on old tasks and preserving past knowledge. We further introduce an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy that adjusts constraint strength dynamically based on interference signals observed during test-time adaptation, striking a balance between stability and adaptability. Extensive experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE achieves robust generalization, significantly reduces forgetting, and consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9% on average across diverse task orders.

This problem is known to be solvable very efficiently, requiring roughly $O(\log n)$ samples and running in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time. The quality of the output is measured via the total variation distance to the unknown distribution, and the approximation factor of the algorithm determines how large this distance is compared to the optimal distance achieved by the best candidate hypothesis. It is known that $\alpha = 3$ is the optimal approximation factor for this problem. We study hypothesis selection under the constraint of differential privacy. We propose a differentially private algorithm in the central model that runs in nearly-linear time with respect to the number of hypotheses, achieves the optimal approximation factor, and incurs only a modest increase in sample complexity, which remains polylogarithmic in $n$. This resolves an open question posed by [Bun, Kamath, Steinke, Wu, NeurIPS 2019]. Prior to our work, existing upper bounds required quadratic time.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages; to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice, training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Data on the Brain & Mind</p></details> |

Traditional Granger causality tests based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover, real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments, without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the demands of real-time posterior updating, model checking, and communication introduce practical methodological challenges. In particular, sensitivity and scenario analysis help trace forecast shifts to model assumptions and understand model behavior. Yet, under standard Markov chain Monte Carlo, even small tweaks to the model (e.g., in priors, data, hyperparameters) require full refitting, making such real-time analysis computationally expensive. To overcome the bottleneck, we introduce a meta-modeling strategy paired with a sequential sampling scheme; by traversing posterior meta-models, we enable real-time inference and structured scenario and sensitivity analysis without repeated refitting. In a back-test of the model, we show substantial computational gains and uncover non-trivial sensitivity patterns. For example, forecasts remain responsive to prior confidence in fundamentals-based forecasts, but less so to random walk scale; these help clarify the relative influence of polling data versus structural assumptions.

The quadratic cost poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32 times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study, we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in the models' accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is formulated based on differential equations of the system and accounts for the peculiarities of power distribution systems with distributed generations. It considers the presence of loads, multi-phase laterals and sub-laterals, heterogenous overhead and underground lines, and infeeds and remote-end fault current contributions of distributed generations. It utilizes data collected by limited number of measuring devices installed in modern power distribution systems to systematically eliminate possible multiple fault location estimations to provide a single correct estimation of the actual location of the fault. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using IEEE 34-node test system.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This data structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal image analysis.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations, thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series. In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with different contamination ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

Despite major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance, SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed approach in full are planned in the very near future.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code, guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.</p></details> | None |

The effect of verification manifests through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii) the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime -- where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime -- where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms -- sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models corroborate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach combines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with a stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergence and safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinal control problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning task, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to Lyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in a closed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policy trained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRL framework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantum policy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control performance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observed under aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution, validating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantum reinforcement learning architectures. The proposed framework provides a foundational step toward provably safe quantum control in autonomous systems and hybrid quantum-classical optimization domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 20 equations, 3 appendices, 4 tables</p></details> |

We study a continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise. Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths. Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in biological circuits.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> | version2 |

This is non-standard and surprising as typically noisy gradient descent with fixed noise level only converges to a stationary regime where the noise causes the dynamic to fluctuate around a minimiser.</p></details> |  |

One way to catch regressions before they reach production is executing performance tests before deployment, e.g., using microbenchmarks, which measure performance at subroutine level. In projects with many microbenchmarks, this may take several hours due to repeated execution to get accurate results, disqualifying them from frequent use in CI/CD pipelines. We propose $\mu$OpTime, a static approach to reduce the execution time of microbenchmark suites by configuring the number of repetitions for each microbenchmark. Based on the results of a full, previous microbenchmark suite run, $\mu$OpTime determines the minimal number of (measurement) repetitions with statistical stability metrics that still lead to accurate results. We evaluate $\mu$OpTime with an experimental study on 14 open-source projects written in two programming languages and five stability metrics. Our results show that (i) $\mu$OpTime reduces the total suite execution time (measurement phase) by up to 95.83% (Go) and 94.17% (Java), (ii) the choice of stability metric depends on the project and programming language, (iii) microbenchmark warmup phases have to be considered for Java projects (potentially leading to higher reductions), and (iv) $\mu$OpTime can be used to reliably detect performance regressions in CI/CD pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

However, its direct application in finance remains challenging due to substantial differences in data characteristics across domains. Specifically, financial systems feature inherent stochasticity and low signal-to-noise ratios, rendering traditional methods and pre-training approaches ineffective. This underscores the urgent need for a foundation model tailored to financial time series. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{LENS}, a pre-trained model for this domain. \textbf{LENS} effectively captures the complexity of financial stochastic systems through a carefully crafted model architecture and mitigates noise during pre-training by using an invertible embedding module.

Even states with negligible probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states, i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECSQARU 2025</p></details> |

These schemes allow vehicles to make reservation requests for the required resources. Accordingly, a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) can allocate and guarantee bandwidth resources based on these requests. However, due to uncertainty in future reservation time and bandwidth costs, the design of an optimized reservation strategy is challenging. In this article, we propose a novel multi-objective bandwidth reservation update approach with an optimal strategy based on Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN). The key design objectives are to minimize the reservation cost with multiple MNOs and to ensure reliable resource provisioning in uncertain situations by solving scenarios such as underbooked and overbooked reservations along the driving path. The enhancements and advantages of our proposed strategy have been demonstrated through extensive experimental results when compared to other methods like greedy update or other deep reinforcement learning approaches. Our strategy demonstrates a 40% reduction in bandwidth costs across all investigated scenarios and simultaneously resolves uncertain situations in a cost-effective manner.</p></details> | 14 pages, 15 figures |

However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Early and accurate sepsis prediction (SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality.

This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE) mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal representation learning.

A key technical challenge is designing an effective preloading strategy that dynamically selects and prioritizes download tasks from an evolving playlist, balancing Quality of Experience (QoE) and bandwidth efficiency under practical commercial constraints. However, real world analysis reveals critical limitations of existing approaches: (1) insufficient adaptation of download task sizes to dynamic conditions, and (2) watch time prediction models that are difficult to deploy reliably at scale. In this paper, we propose DeLoad, a novel preloading framework that addresses these issues by introducing dynamic task sizing and a practical, multi dimensional watch time estimation method. Additionally, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enhanced agent is trained to optimize the download range decisions adaptively. Extensive evaluations conducted on an offline testing platform, leveraging massive real world network data, demonstrate that DeLoad achieves significant improvements in QoE metrics (34.4% to 87.4% gain). Furthermore, after deployment on a large scale commercial short video platform, DeLoad has increased overall user watch time by 0.09% while simultaneously reducing rebuffering events and 3.76% bandwidth consumption.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial symmetries, such as reflection, rotation, and translation, while largely neglecting temporal symmetries. To address this gap, we explore time reversal symmetry, a form of temporal symmetry commonly found in robotics tasks such as door opening and closing. We propose Time Reversal symmetry enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (TR-DRL), a framework that combines trajectory reversal augmentation and time reversal guided reward shaping to efficiently solve temporally symmetric tasks. Our method generates reversed transitions from fully reversible transitions, identified by a proposed dynamics-consistent filter, to augment the training data. For partially reversible transitions, we apply reward shaping to guide learning, according to successful trajectories from the reversed task. Extensive experiments on the Robosuite and MetaWorld benchmarks demonstrate that TR-DRL is effective in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving higher sample efficiency and stronger final performance compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are the main tool used to assess the accuracy of prognostic biomarkers for outcomes that evolve over time. Recognising the need to account for patient heterogeneity when evaluating the accuracy of a prognostic biomarker, we introduce a novel penalised-based estimator of the time-dependent ROC curve that accommodates a possible modifying effect of covariates. We consider flexible models for both the hazard function of the event time given the covariates and biomarker and for the location-scale regression model of the biomarker given covariates, enabling the accommodation of non-proportional hazards and nonlinear effects through penalised splines, thus overcoming limitations of earlier methods. The simulation study demonstrates that our approach successfully recovers the true functional form of the covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curve and the corresponding area under the curve across a variety of scenarios. Comparisons with existing methods further show that our approach performs favourably in multiple settings. Our approach is applied to evaluate the ability of the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score to predict mortality over different time periods after discharge in patients who have suffered an acute coronary syndrome and to investigate how this ability may vary with the left ventricular ejection fraction. An R package, CondTimeROC, implementing the proposed method is provided.</p></details> |  |

Addressing key challenges like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches, MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features: (1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics, priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs' semantic comprehension while resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" through strict state-action mapping, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability.

We introduce a complete pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model, running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in real-time via the recognized actions.</p></details> |  |

The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> |  |

Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was first submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024.

Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries, access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases, community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.</p></details> |  |

Thus, TTDA is very useful in natural language processing (NLP) in the dialectal setting, since oftentimes, models are trained on Standard American English (SAE), evaluated on Indian English (IndE), Singaporean English (SingE), or Nigerian English (NgE), of which distribution differs significantly from the former. This is especially useful since dialectal datasets are scarce. In this paper, we explore one of the most famous TTDA techniques, SHOT, in dialectal NLP. We finetune and evaluate SHOT on different combinations of dialectal GLUE. Our findings show that SHOT is a viable technique when labeled datasets are unavailable. We also theoretically propose the concept of dialectal gap and show that it has a positive correlation with the effectiveness of SHOT. We also find that in many cases, finetuning on SAE yields higher performance than finetuning on dialectal data.</p></details> |  |

To develop an automated way of online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively. Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover, plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This has motivated divide-and-conquer-based approaches for scalable inference. These divide the data into subsets, perform inference for each subset in parallel, and then combine these inferences. While appealing theoretical properties and practical performance have been demonstrated for independent observations, scalable inference for dependent data remains challenging. In this work, we study the problem of Bayesian inference from very long time series. The literature in this area focuses mainly on approximate approaches that usually lack rigorous theoretical guarantees and may provide arbitrarily poor accuracy in practice. We propose a simple and scalable divide-and-conquer method, and provide accuracy guarantees. Numerical simulations and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

While promising, transformers' computational cost scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the significant performance improvements. We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to linear ($O(N)$). Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.

We present WebGraphEval, a framework that abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models</p></details> |

One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.</p></details> |  |

The optimization problem is posed in the likeness of a multiple-shooting approach, aiming for segment-to-segment continuity while tracking proximity to the original CR3BP structures. The analysis of various formulations leads to the selection of an unconstrained least-squares problem for further investigation. The nonlinear optimization problem is convexified and the use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as an alternative to the minimum-norm update equation found in most literature, is investigated for its control over the update step and inherent robustness. Additional techniques such as adaptive weighting are employed to further consolidate the behavior of the proposed algorithm in challenging scenarios. Numerical trials evaluate the adequacy of the methodology presented and compare it to the minimum-norm baseline over various application cases, including the generation of quasi-periodic trajectories and orbital transfers between them. The proposed approach is found to outperform the baseline in applications where the initial guess is poor and the ease of including proximity constraints provides benefits in control over the shape of the converged solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Advances in Space Research</p></details> |

Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

To contain the computational cost and facilitate data visualization, both MD and FD computations were done in two space dimensions. The MD argon trajectories were binned to the FD grid, and the optimal diffusion coefficient was estimated by minimizing the difference between the binned MD data and the FD solution with a nonlinear least squares procedure (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm). Numerical results show the effect of the MD binning parameter and FD grid spacing.

In stochastic models every simulation is run with a specific parameter set and an implicit or explicit random seed, where each parameter set and random seed combination generates an individual realization, or trajectory, sampled from an underlying random process. Existing BO approaches typically rely on summary statistics over the realizations, such as means, medians, or quantiles, potentially limiting their effectiveness when trajectory-level information is desired. We propose a trajectory-oriented Bayesian optimization method that incorporates a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate using both input parameters and random seeds as inputs, enabling direct inference at the trajectory level. Using a common random number (CRN) approach, we define a surrogate-based likelihood over trajectories and introduce an adaptive Thompson Sampling algorithm that refines a fixed-size input grid through likelihood-based filtering and Metropolis-Hastings-based densification. This approach concentrates computation on statistically promising regions of the input space while balancing exploration and exploitation. We apply the method to stochastic epidemic models, a simple compartmental and a more computationally demanding agent-based model, demonstrating improved sampling efficiency and faster identification of data-consistent trajectories relative to parameter-only inference.</p></details> |  |

Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</p></details> |  |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Indian Control Conference</p></details> |

However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN) paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi- mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive anomalies (66.8%).

Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels.

However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Main Track</p></details> |

While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been proposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion planning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed obstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT (Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning framework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly incorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our method is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a unified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed) and potential obstacles. This belief is further processed through a collision-aware inference mechanism that transforms spatial uncertainty and trajectory proximity into a time-varying observation urgency map. By integrating urgency values within the current field of view, we define differentiable objectives that enable real-time, observation-aware trajectory planning with computation times under 10 ms. Simulation and real-world experiments in dynamic, cluttered, and occluded environments show that our method detects potential dynamic obstacles 2.8 seconds earlier than baseline approaches, increasing dynamic obstacle visibility by over 500\%, and enabling safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |

This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles, pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion. Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with prior approaches.

State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy constraints can be systematically computed. However, strict requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical situations. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that leverages graph search to generate long-range trajectories by stitching short trajectory segments together in real time. STITCHER is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through its innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Simulation results show safe trajectories through complex environments can be generated in milliseconds that cover tens of meters.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories.

However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</p></details> |  |

We propose SteeringTTA, an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to balance exploration and confidence.

The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

The resulting problem is formulated as a priority-aware Markov decision process and solved using epsilon-greedy off-policy Q-learning, considering UAV kinematic and flight corridor constraints.

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |

However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density. Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs' zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output. This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Generative and Agentic AI for Multi-Modality Space-Time Intelligence</p></details> |

However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Building upon grasp-matrix formulations and internal force redundancy, we propose a feedback wrench controller that actively regulates the payload's pose while an optimization layer dynamically shapes internal-force oscillations to guarantee persistent carrier motion. Preliminary experimental results on multirotor UAVs validate the model assumptions, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the method successfully prevents carrier stagnation, achieves accurate load tracking, and generates physically feasible trajectories with smooth velocity profiles. The proposed framework not only advances the state of the art but also offers a reliable, versatile solution for future real-world applications requiring load transportation by coordinated non-stopping flying carriers.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments. Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://adap-rpf.github.io/</p></details> |

While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning.

This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque, non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.</p></details> |  |

We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.</p></details> |  |

Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the MICCAI 2025 Learning with Longitudinal Medical Images and Data Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Flow-Opt: Scalable Centralized Multi-Robot Trajectory Optimization with Flow Matching and Differentiable Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09204v1)** | 2025-10-10 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.09204v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization. Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model. We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture different collision-avoidance behaviors.</p></details> |  |

This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues, enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control and mesh animations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bestzzhang.github.io/FlexTraj</p></details> |

Existing methods rely on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization. We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics. Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs, TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.</p></details> |  |

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm, software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-, warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.</p></details> |  |

This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

However, environmental perturbations or execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution. We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure.

These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: RepairAgent, AutoCodeRover, and OpenHands. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2,822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics, such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence of thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection.

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete, particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates; for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time. In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over standard reductions.</p></details> |  |

This transparency also opens a promising direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together, this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities.

Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper, we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations.

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this 8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55 safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61 plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasi- bility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> |  |

Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |

The dynamics of those agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels. Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents. However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines, and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be preferable.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters journal and presented at the 40th Anniversary of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, which was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 23-26 September, 2024</p></details> |

We present Dynamic Neural Potential Field (NPField-GPT), a learning-enhanced model predictive control (MPC) framework that couples classical optimization with a Transformer-based predictor of footprint-aware repulsive potentials. Given an occupancy sub-map, robot footprint, and optional dynamic-obstacle cues, our autoregressive NPField-GPT head forecasts a horizon of differentiable potentials that are injected into a sequential quadratic MPC program via L4CasADi, yielding real-time, constraint-aware trajectory optimization. We additionally study two baselines: (NPField-D1) static-frame decomposition and (NPField-D2) parallel MLP heads for all steps. In dynamic indoor scenarios from BenchMR and on a Husky UGV in office corridors, NPField-GPT produces safer, more conservative trajectories under motion changes, while D1/D2 offer lower latency. We also compare with the CIAO* and MPPI baselines. Across methods, the Transformer+MPC synergy preserves the transparency and stability of model-based planning while learning only the part that benefits from data: spatiotemporal collision risk.

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |

Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.</p></details> |  |

In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the 44th Chinese Control Conference, 2025.

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.</p></details> |  |

The importance of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented on skid-steered mobile platforms.</p></details> |  |

Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards. However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather, Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs, producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a 3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2 requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under 100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales. Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable, real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.</p></details> |  |

It is challenging for governments to tackle these incidents and to rebuild the economic, social and physical infrastructures and facilities with the available resources (mainly budget and time). Governments always define plans and policies according to the law and political strategies that should maximise social benefits. The severity of damage and the vast resources needed to bring life back to normality make such reconstruction a challenge. This article is the extension of our previously published work by conducting comprehensive comparative analysis by integrating additional deep learning models plus random agent which is used as a baseline. Our prior research introduced a decision support system by using the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique for the planning of post-disaster city reconstruction, maximizing the social benefit of the reconstruction process, considering available resources, meeting the needs of the broad community stakeholders (like citizens' social benefits and politicians' priorities) and keeping in consideration city's structural constraints (like dependencies among roads and buildings). The proposed approach, named post disaster REbuilding plAn ProvIdeR (REPAIR) is generic. It can determine a set of alternative plans for local administrators who select the ideal one to implement, and it can be applied to areas of any extension.

Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets.

We built a lexicon that links each activity to specific elements and spaces within parks present in OpenStreetMap. Using this data, we scored 23,477 parks across 35 cities worldwide based on their ability to support these activities. We found clear patterns: parks in North America focus more on physical activity, while those in Europe offer more chances to enjoy nature. Parks near city centers support health-promoting activities better than those farther out. Suburban parks in many cities lack the spaces and equipment needed for nature-based, social, and cultural activities. We also found large gaps in park quality between cities.

| **[A Modular AIoT Framework for Low-Latency Real-Time Robotic Teleoperation in Smart Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11421v1)** | 2025-10-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.11421v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an AI-driven IoT robotic teleoperation system designed for real-time remote manipulation and intelligent visual monitoring, tailored for smart city applications. The architecture integrates a Flutter-based cross-platform mobile interface with MQTT-based control signaling and WebRTC video streaming via the LiveKit framework. A YOLOv11-nano model is deployed for lightweight object detection, enabling real-time perception with annotated visual overlays delivered to the user interface. Control commands are transmitted via MQTT to an ESP8266-based actuator node, which coordinates multi-axis robotic arm motion through an Arduino Mega2560 controller. The backend infrastructure is hosted on DigitalOcean, ensuring scalable cloud orchestration and stable global communication. Latency evaluations conducted under both local and international VPN scenarios (including Hong Kong, Japan, and Belgium) demonstrate actuator response times as low as 0.2 seconds and total video latency under 1.2 seconds, even across high-latency networks. This low-latency dual-protocol design ensures responsive closed-loop interaction and robust performance in distributed environments. Unlike conventional teleoperation platforms, the proposed system emphasizes modular deployment, real-time AI sensing, and adaptable communication strategies, making it well-suited for smart city scenarios such as remote infrastructure inspection, public equipment servicing, and urban automation. Future enhancements will focus on edge-device deployment, adaptive routing, and integration with city-scale IoT networks to enhance resilience and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Road Damage and Manhole Detection using Deep Learning for Smart Cities: A Polygonal Annotation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03797v1)** | 2025-10-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.03797v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve 78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score) classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Analyzing the Performance of a 2.72kWp Rooftop Grid tied Photovoltaic System in Tarlac City, Philippines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03487v1)** | 2025-10-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.03487v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Residential and industrial areas are using rooftop grid-tied Photovoltaic (PV) systems, which are becoming increasingly popular. This is because solar energy reduces electrical consumption and provides free energy, while also lowering carbon emissions to create a more sustainable environment. This paper aims to analyze the 2.72kW p rooftop grid-tied PV system performance between 2020 and 2023 in Tarlac City, Philippines. The PV generated yearly is measured by Array Yield (YA), Reference Yield (YR), and Final Yield (YF), which were found to be valued at 3.12, 3.9, and 3.01 kWh/kWp, respectively. The efficiency can decrease due to System Loss (LS) and Capture Loss (LC), which were 0.78 and 0.12 kWh/kWp, respectively. This results in a Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) of 15.52% and a Performance Ratio (PR) of 77.10%. The productivity of PV resulted in an array efficiency was 12.89%, an inverter efficiency was 94.3%, and a system efficiency was 12.16%. PV energy generation was 3,699 kWh, with 2380 kWh fed into the grid annually. The system's annual revenue is $690.59. The payback period is 6 years with a 238.2% Return On Investment (ROI). Carbon emissions are reduced by 0.379 tCO2/kWp/yr.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, Published with International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology (IJETT)</p></details> |
| **[Smart Routing for EV Charge Point Operators in Mega Cities: Case Study of Istanbul](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21369v2)** | 2025-10-02 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.21369v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) has made it even more important to manage the charging infrastructure sustainably. The expansion of charging station networks, especially in large cities, creates serious logistical challenges for charging point operators (CPOs) in planning maintenance and repair activities. Inefficient field personnel management can lead to time loss, high operational costs, and resource waste. This study presents an integrated method to optimize the planning of EV charging network maintenance operations. The proposed approach groups charging stations according to geographical proximity using the K-means clustering algorithm and calculates the shortest routes between clusters using a genetic algorithm. The method was developed in Python and applied to a dataset consisting of 100 EV charging stations in Istanbul. Considering the population density, traffic density, and resource constraints of Istanbul, the route planning approach presented in this study has great potential, especially for such metropolises. According to the different parameter configurations tested, the most efficient scenario provided approximately 35\% distance savings compared to the reference route created according to the sequential data layout. While the reference route provides a simple comparison, the study presents a solution that will enable field operations in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul to be conducted in a more efficient, planned and scalable manner. In future studies, it is planned to integrate real-time factors such as traffic conditions and field technician constraints.</p></details> |  |

The limited computational resources of these devices make them especially susceptible to attacks, while their widespread adoption increases the potential impact of security breaches. This article presents a review of security proposals aimed at protecting IoT devices in Smart City environments. The review was conducted by analyzing recent literature on device-level security, with particular emphasis on lightweight cryptography, physically unclonable functions (PUFs), and blockchain-based solutions. Findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of current approaches, as well as the need for more practical, scalable, and resource-efficient mechanisms to ensure user privacy and data protection in IoT ecosystems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Mobility Behavior Evolution During Extended Emergencies: Returners, Explorers, and the 15-Minute City](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00469v1)** | 2025-10-01 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.00469v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human mobility during emergencies is critical for strengthening urban resilience and guiding emergency management. This study examines transitions between returners, who repeatedly visit a limited set of locations, and explorers, who travel across broader destinations, over a 15-day emergency period in a densely populated metropolitan region using the YJMob100K dataset. High-resolution spatial data reveal intra-urban behavioral dynamics often masked at coarser scales. Beyond static comparisons, we analyze how mobility evolves over time, with varying emergency durations, across weekdays and weekends, and relative to neighborhood boundaries, linking the analysis to the 15-minute city framework. Results show that at least two weeks of data are required to detect meaningful behavioral shifts. During prolonged emergencies, individuals resume visits to non-essential locations more slowly than under normal conditions. Explorers markedly reduce long distance travel, while weekends and holidays consistently exhibit returner-like, short distance patterns. Residents of low Points of Interest (POI) density neighborhoods often travel to POI rich areas, highlighting spatial disparities. Strengthening local accessibility may improve urban resilience during crises. Full reproducibility is supported through the project website: https://github.com/wissamkontar</p></details> |  |

An urban area is considered a ``15-minute city" if every resident can access essential services within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from their home. However, there is an ongoing debate about the effectiveness of this model in reducing car usage and carbon emissions. In this study, we conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis to evaluate the impact of service proximity to homes on CO$_2$ emissions. By examining nearly 400 cities worldwide, we discover that, within the same city, areas with services located closer to residents produce less CO$_2$ emissions per capita from transportation. We establish a clear relationship between the proximity of services and CO$_2$ emissions for each city. Additionally, we quantify the potential reduction in emissions for 30 cities if they optimise the location of their services. This optimisation maintains each city's total number of services while redistributing them to ensure equal accessibility throughout the entire urban area. Our findings indicate that improving the proximity of services can significantly reduce expected urban emissions related to transportation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Egocentric Visual-Inertial SLAM at City Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26639v1)** | 2025-09-30 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.26639v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift, academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors. We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale. This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at https://www.lamaria.ethz.ch.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820v2)** | 2025-09-28 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15820v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[UrbanFeel: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Temporal and Perceptual Understanding of City Scenes through Human Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22228v1)** | 2025-09-26 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.22228v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development. Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as beautiful and safety.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on resource-constrained mobile devices in real-time remains a significant challenge due to two compute-intensive stages: level-of-detail (LoD) search and rasterization. In this paper, we propose Voyager, an effective solution to accelerate city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians within the view frustum remains roughly constant. Leveraging this temporal correlation, we propose a temporal-aware LoD search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the remaining rendering stages. For the remaining rendering process, we accelerate the bottleneck stage, rasterization, via preemptive $\alpha$-filtering. With all optimizations above, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves up to 6.6$\times$ speedup and 85\% energy savings with superior rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

In this context, the main objective of this study is to propose an innovative methodology to automatically evaluate the level of digital transformation (DT) in public sector organizations. The proposed approach combines traditional assessment methods with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The methodology follows a dual approach: on the one hand, surveys are conducted using specialized staff from various public entities; on the other, AI-based models (including neural networks and transformer architectures) are used to estimate the DT level of the organizations automatically. Our approach has been applied to a real-world case study involving local public administrations in the Valencian Community (Spain) and shown effective performance in assessing DT. While the proposed methodology has been validated in a specific local context, its modular structure and dual-source data foundation support its international scalability, acknowledging that administrative, regulatory, and DT maturity factors may condition its broader applicability. The experiments carried out in this work include (i) the creation of a domain-specific corpus derived from the surveys and websites of several organizations, used to train the proposed models; (ii) the use and comparison of diverse AI methods; and (iii) the validation of our approach using real data. The integration of technologies such as the IoT, sensor networks, and AI-based analytics can significantly support resilient, agile urban environments and the transition towards more effective and sustainable Smart City models.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures |

However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Residents of Atlanta and DeKalb County, environmental activists, police and prison abolitionists, and other activists and concerned individuals formed the movement in opposition to the facility, known as the Stop Cop City / Defend the Atlanta Forest movement. Social media and digital maps became common tools for communicating information about the facility and the movement. Here, we examine online maps about the facility and the opposition movement, originating from grassroots organizations, the City of Atlanta, news media outlets, the Atlanta Police Foundation, and individuals. We gather and examine 32 publicly available maps collected through the Google Search API, Twitter (now X), Instagram and reddit. Using a framework of critical cartography, we conduct a content analysis of these maps to identify the mapping technologies and techniques (data, cartographic elements, styles) used by different stakeholders and roles that maps and mapping technologies can play in social movements. We examine the extent to which these maps provide data to confirm or contradict concerns raised by grassroots organizations and local residents about the facility. We find that stakeholders and mapmakers use geospatial tools in different ways and likely have varied access to mapping technologies. We argue that documenting the use of maps to communicate information about a contentious project can help enumerate community positions and perspectives, and we advocate for accessible mapmaking tools. We conclude by discussing the implications of accessibility of mapping technology and posting maps to social media, and share example map images that extend the geographic information systems (GIS) techniques seen in the retrieved maps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PCQ294</p></details> |

In addition to citizen engagement, a smart city enables connected infrastructure, data-driven decision making and smart mobility. For most of these features, network data plays a critical role, particularly from public Wi-Fi infrastructures, where cities can benefit from optimized services such as public transport management and the safety and efficiency of large events. One of the biggest concerns in developing a smart city is using secure and private data. This is particularly relevant in the case of Wi-Fi network data, where sensitive information can be collected. This paper specifically addresses the problem of sharing secure data to enhance the quality of the Wi-Fi network in a city. Despite the high importance of this type of data, related work focuses on improving the safety of mobility patterns, targeting only the protection of MAC addresses. On the opposite side, we provide a practical methodology for safeguarding all attributes in real Wi-Fi network data. This study was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of legal experts, data custodians and technical privacy specialists, resulting in high-quality data. On top of that, we show how to integrate the legal considerations for secure data sharing. Our approach promotes data-driven innovation and privacy awareness in the context of smart city initiatives, which have been tested in a real scenario.</p></details> |  |

Using compressed transformer models and Llama-3-8B for annotation, we classify sentiment across heterogeneous text domains.

We benchmark five models (DistilRoBERTa, DistilBERT, MiniLM, ELECTRA, TinyBERT) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1-score, AUC, and training time. DistilRoBERTa achieved the highest F1 (0.8292), TinyBERT the best efficiency, and MiniLM the best cross-platform consistency. Results show News data yields inflated performance due to class imbalance, Reddit suffers from summarization loss, and Twitter offers moderate challenge. Compressed models perform competitively, challenging assumptions that larger models are necessary.

We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring equal selection probability for constituents ex ante. We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.</p></details> |  |

However, the intensive manual effort required to prepare input 3D city models has hindered its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we present VoxCity, an open-source Python package that provides a one-stop solution for grid-based 3D city model generation and urban environment simulation for cities worldwide. VoxCity's `generator' subpackage automatically downloads building heights, tree canopy heights, land cover, and terrain elevation within a specified target area, and voxelizes buildings, trees, land cover, and terrain to generate an integrated voxel city model. The `simulator' subpackage enables users to conduct environmental simulations, including solar radiation and view index analyses. Users can export the generated models using several file formats compatible with external software, such as ENVI-met (INX), Blender, and Rhino (OBJ). We generated 3D city models for eight global cities, and demonstrated the calculation of solar irradiance, sky view index, and green view index. We also showcased microclimate simulation and 3D rendering visualization through ENVI-met and Rhino, respectively, through the file export function. Additionally, we reviewed openly available geospatial data to create guidelines to help users choose appropriate data sources depending on their target areas and purposes. VoxCity can significantly reduce the effort and time required for 3D city model preparation and promote the utilization of urban environment simulations. This contributes to more informed urban and architectural design that considers environmental impacts, and in turn, fosters sustainable and livable cities. VoxCity is released openly at https://github.com/kunifujiwara/VoxCity.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Deep Neural Network with Frequency-Aware Channel and Spatial Refinement for Flood Prediction in Sustainable Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08003v1)** | 2025-09-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.08003v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore, existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components: (1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively, surpassing existing methods by significant margins.</p></details> |  |

Conventional fixes enlarge the training set or replay past data, but these strategies incur high data collection costs, sample inefficiently and fail to balance long- and short-term experience, leaving them short of human-like continual learning. Here we introduce Dual-LS, a task-free, online continual learning paradigm for DNN-based motion forecasting that is inspired by the complementary learning system of the human brain. Dual-LS pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval while dynamically coordinating long-term and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on naturalistic data spanning three countries, over 772,000 vehicles and cumulative testing mileage of 11,187 km show that Dual-LS mitigates catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31\% and reduces computational resource demand by up to 94.02\%, markedly boosting predictive stability in vehicle motion forecasting without inflating data requirements. Meanwhile, it endows DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting with computation efficient and human-like continual learning adaptability fit for smart cities.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations. Leveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of downstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban simulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 4D cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

| **[IoT-based Noise Monitoring using Mobile Nodes for Smart Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00979v1)** | 2025-08-31 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.00979v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals. The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle. To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali. Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling effective noise pollution management and urban planning.</p></details> |  |

While this information offers unprecedented opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale, latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge, LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources. Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation, this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable smart infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

It is common that large software systems offer a web interface for user interaction. Usually, available web interfaces are not regarded in software visualization tools. This paper introduces additions to the web-based live tracing software visualization tool ExplorViz: We add an embedded web view for instrumented applications in the 3D visualization to ease interaction with the given applications and enable the exploration of the thereby displayed HTML content. Namely, the Document Object Model (DOM) is visualized via a three-dimensional representation of the HTML structure in same-origin contexts. Our visualization approach is evaluated in a preliminary user study. The study results give insights into the potential use cases, benefits, and shortcomings of our implemented approach. Based on our study results, we propose directions for further research to support the visual exploration of web interfaces and explore use cases for the combined visualization of software cities and HTML structure.

| **[Semantic Zoom and Mini-Maps for Software Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00003v1)** | 2025-08-26 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.00003v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software visualization tools can facilitate program comprehension by providing visual metaphors, or abstractions that reduce the amount of textual data that needs to be processed mentally. One way they do this is by enabling developers to build an internal representation of the visualized software and its architecture. However, as the amount of displayed data in the visualization increases, the visualization itself can become more difficult to comprehend. The ability to display small and large amounts of data in visualizations is called visual scalability. In this paper, we present two approaches to address the challenge of visual scalability in 3D software cities. First, we present an approach to semantic zoom, in which the graphical representation of the software landscape changes based on the virtual camera's distance from visual objects. Second, we augment the visualization with a miniature two-dimensional top-view projection called mini-map. We demonstrate our approach using an open-source implementation in our software visualization tool ExplorViz. ExplorViz is web-based and uses the 3D city metaphor, focusing on live trace visualization. We evaluated our approaches in two separate user studies. The results indicate that semantic zoom and the mini-map are both useful additions. User feedback indicates that semantic zoom and mini-maps are especially useful for large software landscapes and collaborative software exploration. The studies indicate a good usability of our implemented approaches. However, some shortcomings in our implementations have also been discovered, to be addressed in future work.

Given this limitation, meeting the low-latency service requirement of 6G networks becomes even more challenging. However, existing 6G IoT management strategies lack real-time operation and mostly rely on discrete actions, which are insufficient to optimise energy consumption. To address these, in this study, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-guided energy management framework to jointly handle the low latency and energy efficiency challenges in 6G IoT networks. In this framework, we provide the twin models through a distributed overlay network and handle the dynamic updates between the data layer and the upper layers of the DT over the Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) protocol. We also design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine with a novel formulated reward function to provide optimal data update times for each of the IoT devices. The RL engine receives a diverse set of environment states from the What-if engine and runs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to output continuous actions to the IoT devices. Based on our simulation results, we observe that the proposed framework achieves a 37% improvement in 95th percentile latency and a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to the existing literature.</p></details> |  |

However, as DTs take active roles in control loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic and adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing authentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require centralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable physical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and distributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a lightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to establish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs without relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind significantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and 4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines, while maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower. These findings highlight its suitability for future smart city deployments requiring efficient, resilient, and trustworthy DT authentication.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, Accepted by IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.</p></details> |  |

It then evolved rapidly by including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different application domains and research communities, acknowledging the interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the Model-Driven Engineering community.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the quality and biases of AI-generated Open Building Datasets (OBDs) generated by Google and Microsoft against OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, across diverse global cities including Accra, Nairobi, Caracas, Berlin, and Houston. The Intersection over Union (IoU), overlap analysis and a positional accuracy algorithm are used to analyse the similarity and alignment of the datasets. The paper also analyses the size distribution of the building polygon area, and completeness using predefined but regular spatial units. The results indicate significant variance in data quality, with Houston and Berlin demonstrating high alignment and completeness, reflecting their structured urban environments. There are gaps in the datasets analysed, and cities like Accra and Caracas may be under-represented. This could highlight difficulties in capturing complex or informal regions. The study also notes different building size distributions, which may be indicative of the global socio-economic divide. These findings may emphasise the need to consider the quality of global building datasets to avoid misrepresentation, which is an important element of planning and resource distribution.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 pages |

As cities increasingly deploy artificial intelligence (AI) systems, concerns around equity, accountability, and normative legitimacy are growing. This paper introduces the Urban Reasonableness Layer (URL), a conceptual framework that adapts the legal "reasonable person" standard for supervisory oversight in municipal AI systems, including potential future implementations of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Drawing on historical analogies, scenario mapping, and participatory norm-setting, we explore how legal and community-derived standards can inform AI decision-making in urban contexts. Rather than prescribing a fixed solution, the URL is proposed as an exploratory architecture for negotiating contested values, aligning automation with democratic processes, and interrogating the limits of technical alignment. Our key contributions include: (1) articulating the conceptual and operational architecture of the URL; (2) specifying participatory mechanisms for dynamic normative threshold-setting; (3) presenting a comparative scenario analysis of governance trajectories; and (4) outlining evaluation metrics and limitations. This work contributes to ongoing debates on urban AI governance by foregrounding pluralism, contestability, and the inherently political nature of socio-technical systems.</p></details> |  |

These drones must intercept/eliminate the threat, thus reducing potential damage from the attack. We model this as a Sequential Stackelberg Security Game, where the defender first commits to a mixed sequential defense strategy, and the attacker then best responds. We develop an efficient algorithm called S2D2, which outputs a defense strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of S2D2 in extensive experiments on data from 80 real cities, improving the performance of the defender in comparison to greedy heuristics based on prior works. We prove that under some reasonable assumptions about the city structure, S2D2 outputs an approximate Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) with a convenient structure.</p></details> | 59 pages, 10 figures |

Using specialized or foundational models, GenAI's natural language abilities such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) can power tailored applications and unified interfaces, dramatically lowering barriers for users interacting with complex smart city systems. In this paper, we focus on GenAI applications based on conversational interfaces within the context of three critical user archetypes in a Smart City - Citizens, Operators and Planners. We identify and review GenAI models and techniques that have been proposed or deployed for various urban subsystems in the contexts of these user archetypes. We also consider how GenAI can be built on the existing data foundation of official city records, IoT data streams and Urban Digital Twins.

However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.</p></details> |  |

Initially envisioned in the 1950s, the City Tower project is a skyscraper structure based on a tetrahedral and octahedral space frame called Octet-Truss. The aim of this study is to analyze the geometry of the City Tower structure and how it can be used to develop modular and adaptable architectural forms. The study is based on an analytical shape grammar that is used to recreate the original structure, and later to generate new structural configurations based on the City Tower's morphology. This study also investigates the potential applications of these findings in architecture and reveals the possibilities of using tetrahedrons and octahedrons as fundamental geometries for creating scalable and modular designs and presents initial findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, ARCC Conference</p></details> |

The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, the inherent randomness, non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%.

We hypothesize that street view imagery -- an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer relationships between specific types of social interactions and built environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant cities.</p></details> |  |

This paper leverages network science to conduct a multi-modal analysis of San Diego's transportation system. We construct a multi-layer graph using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), representing driving, walking, and public transit layers. By integrating thousands of Points of Interest (POIs), we analyze network accessibility, structure, and resilience through centrality measures, community detection, and a proposed metric for walkability. Our analysis reveals a system defined by a stark core-periphery divide. We find that while the urban core is well-integrated, 30.3% of POIs are isolated from public transit within a walkable distance, indicating significant equity gaps in suburban and rural access. Centrality analysis highlights the driving network's over-reliance on critical freeways as bottlenecks, suggesting low network resilience, while confirming that San Diego is not a broadly walkable city. Furthermore, community detection demonstrates that transportation mode dictates the scale of mobility, producing compact, local clusters for walking and broad, regional clusters for driving. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing urban mobility systems, offering quantitative insights that can inform targeted interventions to improve transportation equity and infrastructure resilience in San Diego.</p></details> |  |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.</p></details> |  |

Conventional smart city mapping techniques, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth. However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei. We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields 40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and (iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work partly supported by the RA Science Committee grant No. 22rl-052 (DISTAL) and the EU under Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan of NextGenerationEU on "Telecommunications of the Future" (PE00000001 - program "RESTART")</p></details> |

While traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable, fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities. This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor. Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\% improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score of predicting immobility compared to the baselines.

We are not trying to reproduce existing cities, but to generate artificial cities that are convincing and plausible by capturing developmental behavior. In addition, our results are meant to build upon themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments, whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions. With the aid of agent based simulation we are generating a system of agents and behaviors that interact with one another through their effects upon a simulated environment. Our philosophy is that as each agent follows a simple behavioral rule set, a more complex behavior will tend to emerge out of the interactions between the agents and their differing rule sets. By confining our model to a set of simple rules for each class of agents, we hope to make our model extendible not only in regard to the types of structures that are produced, but also in describing the social and cultural influences prevalent in all cities</p></details> |  |

Yet existing methods face key limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning, UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.</p></details> |  |

An Agent-Based Simulation of Human Mobility in a Futuristic Smart City](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143v1)** | 2025-07-20 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.15143v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to 8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70 percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.</p></details> |  |

Applications to urban science are numerous, from facilitating comparisons between delineated districts and administrative divisions to informing policymakers of the shifting economic and labor landscapes. In this study, we propose using commute networks sourced from the census for the purpose of urban delineation, by modeling them with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. We derive low-dimensional representations of granular urban areas (nodes) using GNNs. Subsequently, nodes' embeddings are clustered to identify spatially cohesive communities in urban areas. Our experiments across the U.S. demonstrate the effectiveness of network embeddings in capturing significant socioeconomic disparities between communities in various cities, particularly in factors such as median household income. The role of census mobility data in regional delineation is also noted, and we establish the utility of GNNs in urban community detection, as a powerful alternative to existing methods in this domain. The results offer insights into the wider effects of commute networks and their use in building meaningful representations of urban regions.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m, achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation.

Unlike prior approaches, EGC-VMAP directly fuses multi-vehicle, multi-temporal map elements perceived onboard vehicles using a novel Trip-Aware Transformer architecture within a unified learning process. Combined with hierarchical matching for efficient training and a multi-objective loss, our method significantly enhances map accuracy and structural robustness compared to single-vehicle baselines.

Consequently, reusing existing infrastructures to develop alternative communication strategies after disasters is essential to minimise the impact of these events on the population's ability to communicate and promptly receive alerts from authorities. In this context, the emergence of smart cities, characterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents significant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient architecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network, whose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication system to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video) between citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote monitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled flooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and tested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor environments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of obstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average latency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and 726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow network, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all functionalities associated with the HaLert architecture. The tests conducted on the LoRa network revealed a high average message success rate of 94.96%.</p></details> |  |

Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP). However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data (TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions. Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

This study compares iNETs across platforms (Google Places and Foursquare) and spatial granularities, showing that coarser levels reveal more consistent cross-platform patterns, while finer granularities expose subtle, platform-specific behaviors. Our analysis finds that, in general, user interest is primarily shaped by geographic proximity and venue similarity, while socioeconomic and political contexts play a lesser role. Building on these insights, we develop a multi-level, explainable recommendation system that predicts high-interest urban regions for different user types. The model adapts to behavior profiles -- such as explorers, who are driven by proximity, and returners, who prefer familiar venues -- and provides natural-language explanations using explainable AI (XAI) techniques. To support our approach, we introduce h3-cities, a tool for multi-scale spatial analysis, and release a public demo for interactively exploring personalized urban recommendations.

However, most existing methods rely heavily on neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image, achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Advanced time series decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban hospitality forecasting and provide a comparative framework for data-driven decision-making.

Previous wireframe-alignment-based method LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models. However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes. Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2 improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to support trip-level simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

With the number of IoT devices expected to exceed 40 billion by 2030, traditional cloud-based systems are increasingly constrained by bandwidth, latency, and energy limitations. This paper leverages the ROOF (Real-time Onsite Operations Facilitation) framework with decentralized computing at intermediary fog and peripheral edge network layers to reduce latency by processing data near its point of origin. ROOF features fog caching to avoid redundancy, ultra-low-power wireless transmission for energy savings, and AI-driven resource allocation for efficiency. Security is enhanced through TLS encryption, blockchain-based authentication, and edge-level access control. Case studies from Bhubaneswar, Barcelona and Copenhagen validate the use of ROOF in traffic systems and environmental monitoring. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges and prospects of AI-driven analytics in smart urban infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published at the Fifth International Conference on Computing and Communication Networks (ICCCN 2025), Volume 1</p></details> |

We study this interaction by simulating human drivers and AVs. Our experiments with standard MARL algorithms reveal that, both in simplified and complex networks, policies often fail to converge to an optimal solution or require long training periods. This problem is amplified by the fact that we cannot rely entirely on simulated training, as there are no accurate models of human routing behavior. At the same time, real-world training in cities risks destabilizing urban traffic systems, increasing externalities, such as $CO_2$ emissions, and introducing non-stationarity as human drivers will adapt unpredictably to AV behaviors. In this position paper, we argue that city authorities must collaborate with the ML community to monitor and critically evaluate the routing algorithms proposed by car companies toward fair and system-efficient routing algorithms and regulatory standards.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the design considerations and engagement opportunities of public service chatbots, using a 311 chatbot from a metropolitan city as a case study. Our qualitative study consisted of official survey data and 16 interviews examining stakeholder experiences and design preferences for the chatbot. We found two key areas of concern regarding these public chatbots: individual-level and community-level. At the individual level, citizens experience three key challenges: interpretation, transparency, and social contextualization. Moreover, the current chatbot design prioritizes the efficient completion of individual tasks but neglects the broader community perspective. It overlooks how individuals interact and discuss problems collectively within their communities. To address these concerns, we offer design opportunities for creating more intelligent, transparent, community-oriented chatbots that better engage individuals and their communities.</p></details> |  |
